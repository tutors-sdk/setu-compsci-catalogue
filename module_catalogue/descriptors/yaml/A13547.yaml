aim: Evolve a multi-screen mobile application in a networked, message driven, context
  aware application. Incorporate in the application two-way access to remote REST
  (Representational State Transfer) and Messaging services. Integrate on-device context
  including camera, location, motion, climate and other sensors to deliver a rich
  user experience. Incorporate 3rd party components to deliver personalized mapping,
  media and general information services.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to implement a relatively basic application. Cannot grasp fundamentals
  of the application lifecycle or operate an appropriate IDE (Integrated Development
  Environment).'
- '40%-49%: Be able to implement at relatively mid-sized application, with 3 - 5 separate
  views/activities. Understand the basic of the application lifecycle and operate
  an IDE at a basic level.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to model and implement an application of moderate complexity --
  including > 5 views + a simple persistence mechanism. Be able to use an IDE competently
  and debug applications.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to implement a sophisticated application with multiple view /
  navigation mechanisms. The application will have local persistent storage and be
  able to interact with a remote service as a basic level.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent level. In addition the application should
  demonstrate a more sophisticated interaction with external services, and may leverage
  on device sensors and subsystems.'

indicative content:
- Advanced application architectural patterns
- The build, test & deploy lifecycle
- 'Accessing Platform Services: Persistence; Sensors / Subsystems (e.g. Location,
  camera, movement etc.)'
- 'Accessing External Services: Access Patterns (e.g. REST); Third Party Applications
  & Components'
- 'Build Processes: Dependency Management; Build Scripts (e.g. Gradle)'
- Wireless Subsystem APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
- App Store interaction, including key management
learning and teaching methods:
- Lectures will introduce the general context of the curriculum, and explore specific
  topics in depth. Supervised, guided and scripted practicals will lead the student
  through the construction of an application designed to illustrate key concepts covered
  in the lectures. The focus is on learning by doing in a studio environment. Each
  practical will propose a set of exercises -- to be solved in a subsequent practical.
- Assignment One will focus on ensuring the student can construct a new application
  equivalent in style and structure to the guided practical.
- Assignment Two will invite the student to analyse, design and implement a new application.

learning outcomes:
- Select the appropriate design patterns and tools in the development of complex mobile
  apps.
- Comment on the chosen mobile app framework and the underlying hardware components.
- Design and develop complex multi-screen mobile apps from concept through to completion
  using best practices and guidelines.
- Set up the interaction of an application with internal sensors and physical subsystems.
- 'Integrate a remote service API within an application, perhaps based on REST principles,
  to deliver aspects of its core features set. For example: Maps/GIS (Geographic Information
  Systems), Media Sharing, Social Networking.'
