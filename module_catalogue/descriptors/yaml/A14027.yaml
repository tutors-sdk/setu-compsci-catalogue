aim: The aims of this module are to provide students with an understanding of how
  computer file systems organize and store data. Students will learn how different
  operating systems arrange data. The student will use tools to extract and forensically
  analyse these kinds of data.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe concepts of file systems. Unable to use and explain system
  forensics tools and related OS utilities.'
- '40%-49%: Can describe in detail major concepts of file systems. Able to use and
  explain system forensics tools and related OS utilities.'
- '50%-59%: All of the above and in addition can compare and contrast various different
  file systems and data formats.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, be capable of demonstrating an in depth understanding of
  different file systems.'
- '70%-100%: All above to an excellent level.'

indicative content:
- 'Introduction: data analysis & organisation; the booting process'
- 'Hard Disk Acquisition: Host Protected Areas (HPAs); write blockers; cryptographic
  hashes'
- 'Volume Analysis: partitioning schemes'
- 'File System Analysis: file system category; content category; metadata category;
  filename category; application category'
- File Systems
learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and practicals. The lectures
  will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts. The practical element
  allows the student to put into practice the theoretical concepts covered in the
  lectures. Practical work will include the student working with an industry standard
  forensic toolkit.

learning outcomes:
- Describe the concepts of partitions.
- Demonstrate an awareness of issues surrounding the creation of forensic duplicates.
- Analyse file systems of various kinds of operating systems.
- Use a forensic toolkit.
- Demonstrate how to retrieve deleted data.
- Examine the conceptual types of data associated within a file system and how these
  conceptual types of data are implemented in common file systems.
