aim: This module aims to provide students with the skills to investigate computer
  attacks that take place over computer networks. Students gain exposure to penetration
  testing techniques, incident response techniques and traffic analysis methodologies.
  The module has a significant practical component where the student will use various
  analysis tools and techniques to explore the areas listed above.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domain(s).
  Unable to conduct attack, unable to gather data.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domain(s). Can only construct basic attack scenarios. Can conduct partial responses
  to attacks.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge domain and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains. Can implement
  attacks to a moderate level, gather some data and produce some findings.'
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools. Can implement complex attacks, extract knowledge
  to recreate accuratly what occurred on the network.
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools. Can implement advanced attacks
  extract and interpret knowledge to recreate accuratly what occurred on the network.
  Can produce very high quality documentation to accompany the investigation.'
