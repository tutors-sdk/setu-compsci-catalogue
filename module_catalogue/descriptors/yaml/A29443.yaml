aim: It is assumed the student is familiar with the fundamental concepts and techniques
  of Data Mining. The purpose of this module is to apply the theory of Data Mining.
  The student will learn about the data mining process and experience the steps involved;
  including data pre-processing, modelling and optimisation and result interpretation
  and validation. For each step in the data mining process the student will learn
  and apply an appropriate methodology, tool or technology.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to describe and apply key concepts of the data mining process.
- 40%-49%:Be able to describe and apply key concepts of the data mining process.
- 50%-59%:Ability to discuss key concepts of the data mining process and ability to
  discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve data mining problems by applying each step in the data
  mining process.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.
