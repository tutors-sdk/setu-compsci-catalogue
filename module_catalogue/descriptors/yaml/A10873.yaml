indicative content:
- 'Matrix algebra: matrix operations; solution of linear systems using Cramers rule;
  matrix inversion and numerical methods; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; applications
  of eigenvalues/eigenvectors'
- 'Vector algebra: dot and cross product; parametric equation of lines and planes;
  intersection of lines and planes; decomposition of vectors using the dot product'
- 'Linear transformations: Rotations, reflections, and translations; homogeneous coordinates'
- 'Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: diagonalisation and similar matrices; powers of matrices'
- 'Partial differentiation: critical points; local extrema and saddle points'
- 'Vector calculus: gradient, curl and div; volume and surface integrals'
learning and teaching methods:
- Delivery of the module will be through a mixture of lectures, tutorial classes and
  computer laboratory sessions.
- The lectures will develop theory, lead students through worked examples and introduce
  the context for the module material.
- The tutorial classes will underpin and rehearse the skills demonstrated in the lectures
  and described module material.
- The practical sessions will utilise software that supports linear algebra and multivariate
  calculus. Students will use this software to solve selected problems and implement
  matrix and vector operations and algorithms covered in lectures.
- Active engagement with frequent practice on examples is strongly encouraged through
  regular course work and class tests.

learning outcomes:
- Use expressions involving vectors and matrices and find the solution set of a system
  of linear equations using standard methods.
- Compute expressions involving partial derivatives and vector calculus operators.
- Use partial derivatives to determine stationary points of multivariate functions
  and apply techniques to appropriate problems.
- Use vector algebra to solve three-dimensional geometric problems such as finding
  where a given line cuts a given plane, intersection of polygons, etc.
- Apply existing mathematical software and students' own code to represent and solve
  problems arising in computer science.
