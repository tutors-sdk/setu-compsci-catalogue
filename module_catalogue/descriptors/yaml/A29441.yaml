aim: The purpose of this module is to introduce the student to the fundamental concepts
  and techniques of Data Mining. The student will become familiar with Data Mining
  approaches (such as prediction, classification, clustering) and their typical solution
  techniques (methods and algorithms) to datasets that support business intelligence
  applications. The practical part of the module will present a suite of Data Mining
  exercises that the student will solve. During each exercise, the student will apply
  an appropriate Data Mining method and learn to evaluate and interpret the results.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of data mining approaches.
- 40%-49%:Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of data mining approaches.
- 50%-59%:Ability to discuss key concepts of data mining approaches and ability to
  discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve problems using data mining techniques by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.
