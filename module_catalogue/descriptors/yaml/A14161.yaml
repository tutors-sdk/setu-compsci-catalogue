aim: In this module students will learn about business intelligence (BI) concepts,
  methods, and processes for decision support and business process improvement. The
  student will gain an in-depth theoretical understanding of organisation memory,
  information integration, insight creation, information presentation and business
  performance management methods. The student will have both a theoretical knowledge
  of relevant business intelligence concepts, as well as the practical application
  of tools and experiences of their use.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of BI.'
- '40%-59%: Be able to interpret and discuss key concepts of BI and the ability to
  discover and integrate related knowledge in other data and information system modules.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within BI by experimenting with the appropriate
  skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
