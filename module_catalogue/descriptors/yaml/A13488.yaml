aim: The student will explore in detail modern operating systems in the areas of file
  systems, memory management, and process management. This module will introduce the
  student to the concepts and practical application of administering and troubleshooting
  modern operating systems with a strong emphasis on shell scripting.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts and operations of modern operating
  systems.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts and operations of modern
  operating systems.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of operating systems. Be able to perform
  configuration and administration tasks on operating systems.'
- '60%-69%: Ability to plan, design and implement a small mixed network using appropriate
  tools and advanced scripting techniques.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and demonstrate
  unforeseen problems through the use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
