aim: This module aims to make the student security aware. By the end of the module
  the student will be conscious of threats to their data and their person, technologies
  that can be used to help protect them and how to respond to issues that can occur.
  They will also be familiar with digital forensics and the process that occurs at
  each of its stages.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domain(s).
  Unable to define threats or implement security technologies. Unable to outline the
  steps of a forensic investigation.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domain(s). Identify relevant threats, perform basic tasks for security.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge domain and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains. Ability
  to match specific threats and implement security technologies to combat these. Recover
  data in a forensic investigation.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools. Produce high quality documentation for a
  forensic investgation.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
