aim: The aim of this module is to provide students with an introduction to the core
  elements of sport and exercise biomechanics. The module will use applied examples
  and demonstrations to highlight the relevance of these elements in exercise, physical
  activity and sport.

learning outcomes:
- Outline the basic biomechanical concepts underpinning movement in sport.
- Perform basic applied calculations relating to kinematic and kinetic quantities
  (e.g. velocity, acceleration, force).
- Identify the key aspects and applications of equipment used during biomechanical
  testing.
- Collect biomechanical data of a sports movement (e.g. speed, angular data, jump
  data).
- Report on collected/sample biomechanical data.
