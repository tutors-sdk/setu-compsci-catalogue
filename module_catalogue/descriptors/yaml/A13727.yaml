aim: This module approaches web application development from an apps and services
  perspective, as opposed to the monolithic, server-side rendering model. Services
  will be formulated as REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Program
  Interface), while multiple service consumer forms will be considered, including
  Single Page Apps (SPA) and other services. The principles and patterns underpinning
  the design of both components (SPA and REST API ) will be examined as well as the
  fine-grained aspects of the underlying communication protocol. Their will be an
  emphasis on development, including the use of application frameworks, workflow automation
  tools and cloud deployment platforms. The module's scope will also encompass the
  techical aspects of both realtime API communication and isomorphic web apps.

indicative content:
- 'Fundamentals: Architecture patterns; HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol;
  advanced Javascript'
- 'API Design patterns and principles: REST; CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Separation);
  versioning; vecurity; hypermedia; realtime'
- 'SPA design patterns and principles: MV* (Model View *); Flux; caching; data synchronisation'
- 'Application Frameworks: Web API; Single Page App; Isomorphic app'
- 'Developer tool suite: API modelling; DSL(Domain Specific Language); scaffolding;
  workflow automation'
- 'Deployment environments: API gatways; containers'
learning and teaching methods:
- Combination of lectures and computer-based practicals.
- The lectures will cover the theory and supporting technologies behind web app development.
- The lab-based practicals, building on the theoretical knowledge from lectures, provide
  exposure to the frameworks, tools and practical skills required to develop and build
  web apps.
- The practical content will use industry standard technologies, tools and techniques.
- Student will be encouraged to enhance their lab work and assessment submissions
  using self-directed research and learning into the state-of-the-art for web app
  development.
