aim: This module will introduce the student to the basics of professional ethics and
  legal issues regarding data and software artifacts. The student will build an artifact
  based on multiple strands/modules across the programme and examine these issues
  in relation to this artifact. This module will act as an opportunity for the student
  to contextualise and link cross-strand concepts.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Inability to develop a model and present a working artifact. No evidence of
  an understanding on legal and ethical issues involved in the development and deployment
  of the artifact (or the reason why neither are important).
- 40%-49%:Ability to develop a model and present a working artifact. Reasonable evidence
  of an understanding on legal and ethical issues involved in the development and
  deployment of the artifact (or the reason why neither are important).
- 50%-59%:All the above and in addition has applied concepts from more than two modules/strands.
  Strong evidence of a complete checklist of potential legal/ethical issues with clear
  (completed) action plan for each.
- 60%-69%:All the above and in addition, be able to integrate and analyse concepts
  from more than two and at least one past module, showing an ability to transfer
  skills and knowledge across modules/strands.
- 70%-100%:All previous to an excellent level. Shows the ability to evaluate different
  models. Shows synthesis through the implementation of cross-strand innovative artifacts.
  Moving towards a general framework for check-listing legal and ethical issues for
  such artifacts.

learning outcomes:
- Apply knowledge, skills or practices from across the programme, (specifically from
  at least two modules from the programme, at least one module being from the current
  semester) into a model that demonstrates an understanding of the core concepts of
  those modules.
- Demonstrate the above model and present the resulting working artifact.
- Employ a robust and professional framework so that the artefact as described above
  conforms to all legal standards with regard to data protection and all industry
  standards pertaining to copyright, privacy, Intellectual Property(IP), etc.
- Identify personal ethical responsibilities and obligations as technologists and
  the obligations and responsibilities of the community of technologists.
- Apply appropriate developmental and related standards which are designed to address
  ethical considerations (such as privacy and human-centred development) to the development
  and deployment of digital technologies.
