aim: Embedded Systems Scripting module introduces the learner to the Linux operating
  system, commonly used command sets, bash shell scripting and a scripting language
  such as Python. The module will cover Python program syntax from the basic to the
  advanced to enable the learner design and develop complex scripts.
assessment criteria:
- '70% - 100%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at an excellent
  level; demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of the associated subject matter;
  achieved an excellent level of the skills required for the subject matter; demonstrated
  the ability to carry out further investigation and problem solving associated with
  the subject matter.'
- '60% - 69%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a very good
  level; demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved
  a very good level of the skills required for the subject matter.'
- '50% - 59%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a good level;
  demonstrated a good knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a good
  level of the skills required for the subject matter.'
- '40% - 49%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a basic level;
  demonstrated a basic knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a basic
  level of the skills required for the subject matter.'
- '<40%: The learner has not: attained the module learning outcomes; demonstrated
  sufficient knowledge of the associated subject matter; demonstrated a sufficient
  level of the skills required for the subject matter.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This course will be presented by a combination of lectures and computer-based practicals
  whilst capitalising on a web-enhanced learning environment
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts
- The emphasis on course delivery will be hands-on, problem solving both individually
  and in small class groups using problem based worksheets during the practical sessions
- Self-directed learning will be encouraged throughout the duration of the module
