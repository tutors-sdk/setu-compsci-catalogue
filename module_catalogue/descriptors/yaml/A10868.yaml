aim: 'This module is a practical introduction to game design and game design concepts,
  emphasising the basic tools of game design: paper and digital prototyping, design
  iteration, and user testing.'
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to understand, describe and discuss key concepts of game design.
  Inability to apply appropriate techniques and/or tools to solve problems in game
  design.'
- '40%-49%: Ability to understand, describe and discuss key concepts of game design.
  Ability to apply appropriate techniques and/or tools to solve problems in game design.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to analyse and classify key concepts of game design. Be able to
  employ a variety of specialised skills and pre-selected tools or techniques within
  game design.'
- '60%-69%: Ability to exercise appropriate judgement in applying the key concepts
  of game design and demonstrating an ability to be creative in designing and developing
  solutions to problems for game design using the appropriate skills, tools and/or
  techniques.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Ability to demonstrate mastery of
  specialised skills within game design, generalise key concepts and deploy solutions
  to a high standard for a range of complex, specialised and unforeseen problems through
  the use and modification of advanced skills, tools and/or techniques.'

full title: Introduction to Game Design
indicative content:
- Vocabulary and formal elements of game design
- Ideation, early design and prototyping
- Mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics and the concept of 'Fun'
- Narratology and story telling
- Character and level design
- Playtesting and balancing
- Pitching an idea
learning and teaching methods:
- Lectures are used to study and evaluate design thinking in a games context. Lecture
  content is assessed in both assignments, in the form of a game criticism paper and
  a formal game design document.
- Workshops are used to apply design theory to a game concept. Students are required
  to make a polished, playtested and boardgame using these workshops.
