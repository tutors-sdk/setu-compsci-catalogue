aim: 'Sophisticated techniques are used to capture, model, discover and utilize knowledge
  generated within and across organisations wherever that knowledge is located in
  the form of data sources, pdf documents, audio, video or other digital content and
  formats. This knowledge-based ?semantic web?, sometimes called ?Web 4.0? or the
  ?Intelligent Web? is a human-machine environment which both incorporates and supersedes
  Web 2.0 (social web) and Web 3.0 (internet of things) systems. Using techniques
  unpacked in this module, software development teams define and reuse computer-based
  knowledge models to discover and access web services in a coherent, platform independent
  and integrated way. Product knowledge in Amazon?s system, R&D knowledge scattered
  across computers in the automative industry on an extranet system, shared digital
  content across a network of libraries: applications like these and the infrastructure
  on which they sit are now being deployed and managed by engineering knowledge-based
  systems using a model-driven approach. In this course the student will learn the
  fundamentals of these technologies and systems, appreciate how they are engineered
  in today?s systems development and systems management context. They will also learn
  how to represent knowledge using ontologies and how to access and benefit from semantic
  data standards on the web, and how this fits into the overall capability of an organisation?s
  digital systems in the emerging digital landscape.'

  intelligent web.
- Practical, hands on experience using systems engineering tools and code generators
  (e.g. Protege) to build models which can be used to support software development
  and systems management in an organisation, and generating knowledge based systems
  which can map into web services and other web-based resources in a web-enabled enterprise.
