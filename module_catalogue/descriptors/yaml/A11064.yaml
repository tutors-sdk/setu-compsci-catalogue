aim: This module is designed to introduce the student to additional fundamental physics
  principles and will augment the content covered in the semester one physics module
  (Physics I). Problem-solving skills will be developed and used to analyse physical
  situations. The integrated practical programme will enhance the student's experimental,
  logical thinking and report-writing skills.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domain(s).
- 40%-49%:Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domain(s).
- 50%-59%:Ability to discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge domain and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.
