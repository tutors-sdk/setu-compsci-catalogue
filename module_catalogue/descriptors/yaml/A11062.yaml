aim: This module follows on from Computer Systems 1 and focuses mostly on operating
  systems. Topics covered include core operating system functions such as process,
  memory and file management as well as an introduction to distributed systems and
  virtualisation. As with Computer Systems 1, there is an emphasis on practical, lab-based
  exercises with command line tools and some scripting.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to describe operating system concepts. Unable to use command line utilities
  of an OS. Unable to write a basic effective script to demonstrate automation of
  a configuration task.
- 40%-49%:Can describe operating system concepts. Can configure an OS and deploy an
  application. Can use basic command line utilities and write a script to demonstrate
  automation.
- 50%-59%:All of the above. Can describe concepts in more depth. Additionally can
  write a script to automate a non-trivial task.
- 60%-69%:In addition, can carry out more advanced configuration and scripting tasks.
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. In addition can research and execute
  previously unseen configuration and scripting tasks independently.'
