aim: This module will provide an introduction to computer security. The emphasis is
  on the fundamentals of security, including the nature of security threats and attack
  methods. It will also include the services that can be put in place to address these
  threats. Cryptographic techniques, that underpin many security mechanisms, are also
  covered. This module will introduce the student to the foundations of modern cryptography,
  with a focus on practical applications. The importance of security policy and procedures
  will also be explained.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of computer security. Unable
  to interpret and describe computer security threats, vulnerabilities and security
  services. Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of cryptography.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of computer security. Be
  able to interpret and describe computer security threats, vulnerabilities and security
  services. Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of cryptography.'
- '50%-59%: All of the above and the ability to distinguish between the various security
  services necessary to mitigate against a range of security threats and attacks.
  Ability to explain various cryptographic approaches and techniques required to implement
  each security service.'
- '60%-69%: All of the above and be able to evaluate different cryptographic approaches
  and techniques.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of existing security problems.'
