aim: Internet of Things (IoT) applications combine low-level physical world devices
  with higher level IT and cloud-based services. In this module, students learn how
  to develop software applications with the connectivity and interoperability required
  for distributed IoT-based applications. The characteristics and requirements of
  IoT distributed systems is covered in addition to development platforms and technology
  standards currently used in IoT applications. The overall focus of this module is
  the practical design and implementation of full stack IoT-enabled distributed applications.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to explain the key concepts of IoT based distributed applications; unable
  to successfully apply technologies that provide integration necessary for IoT distributed
  applications.
- 40%-49%:Sufficient grasp of the concepts and technology to successfully implement
  a skeleton IoT based application. Can explain the architecture's use of technology
  at all layers.
- 50%-59%:Can design and implement a prototype IoT distributed application, demonstrating
  a range of styles and technologies. Is competent in the use of the tools, frameworks
  and components covered in the labs and lectures.
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools. Is complete in their understanding and demonstration
  of the IoT software technology stacks and architecture choices.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.
