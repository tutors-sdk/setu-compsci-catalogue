aim: The purpose of this module is to give a student the practical knowledge to prepare
  3D Model and audio digital assets for use in rendered 3D animated scenes and to
  be able to appreciate the theory and practice of 3D animation techniques.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and apply the key concepts of Character Rigging and Lassiter''s
  3D Animation Principles.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and apply the key concepts of Character Rigging and
  Lassiter''s 3D Animation Principles.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the rigging and animation principles
  and ability to integrate related knowledge into the animation pipeline.'
