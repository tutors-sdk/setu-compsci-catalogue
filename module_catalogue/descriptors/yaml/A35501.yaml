aim: The purpose of the Industry-led Project is to enable the student to apply the
  knowledge, skills and competencies gained through the academic phase of the course
  through putting them into practice in a relevant workplace environment. This will
  allow the students to consolidate, deepen and contextualise their learning and thereby
  enhance their employability. If a student does not work in a data-rich environment
  then every effort will be made to find a suitable work placement for them. Where
  an appropriate work placement is not possible then the student will conduct a project
  based on data from an industry source under the guidance of an academic supervisor.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Failure to incorporate feedback. Failure to competently demonstrate understanding
  of work.'
- '40%--49%: Produces working, tested solution to minimum requirements. Produces full
  set of documentation. Able to demonstrate own work in competent manner.'
- '50%--59%: As above and produces a working, tested solution to meet most requirements
  (unless failure to do so is justified). Documentation and reports are clear and
  of good quality. Comprehensive knowledge of tools and technologies.'
- '60%--69%: As above and requirements fully met unless failure to do so is justified.
  Demonstrates ability to solve unfamiliar technical problems. Shows good judgement
  in technology selection. Documentation shows evidence of ability to see limitations
  or potential in approaches used.'
- '70%--100%: As above and produces an excellent, professional calibre stand-alone
  system with equally excellent documentation. Demonstrates ability to abstract ideas
  and reflect on the process.'

full title: Data Analytics Project
indicative content:
- A detailed analysis of a large dataset which seeks to address well-formed questions
- The scope of the project must reflect the data analytics context of the programme
- The student completes a project report that reflects the business needs of the organisation
- The host company and the course board will co-operate in allowing the student to
  complete a work-based project
- Where an appropriate work placement is not available then the student will conduct
  a project based on data from an industry source under the guidance of an academic
  supervisor
learning and teaching methods:
- Students will undergo an induction briefing prior to the beginning of the placement
  and have access to an academic supervisor during the placement period.
- The applied learning portfolio is designed to foster self-reflection on the learning
  gained through participation in the work placement.
- There will be ongoing interaction between the student and their project supervisor
  and the work-placement co-ordinator, where appropriate.
- Where appropriate, an industry mentor will be provided to provide input and guidance
  from the employer's perspective.
