aim: This module will provide the student with an introduction to Computer Science
  and Systems concepts and assumes no prior knowledge of the topic. The student is
  introduced to fundamental computing concepts, terminology, architecture and organisation.
  The theory is largely taught through a series of practical, lab-based exercises
  exploring computer hardware and software, operating systems installation and configuration
  and applications management.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to name or describe computer components. Cannot perform command line
  operation. Poor understanding of basic computer priciples.
- '40%-49%: Can identify and describe operation of computer components. Can perform
  basic command line operations and successfully install an operating system. Can
  build, configure and install an application by following given instructions.'
- 50%-59%:All of the above, plus can configure the operating system through the editing
  of settings files. Can build, configure and install an application without detailed
  instructions. Can reason as to the function of computer components.
- 60%-69%:In addition, can discuss the relative merits of competiting computer components.
  Can implement unseen features in operating systems/applications.
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Demonstrate a deep understanding
  of trade-offs of computer power, speed and storage. Demonstrates knowledge of advanced
  OS operations and application building.'
