aim: The student?s drawing skills will be developed, with an awareness of traditional
  animation techniques, to create 2D objects and characters in a digital environment.
  The Principles of Animation are introduced. The student will produce the main movements
  of objects and characters, and the background scenes for these animations.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to digitally create and animate simple 2D objects and characters.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to digitally create and animate simple 2D objects and characters.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to create and animate 2D objects and characters within a scene
  to tell a story.'
- '60%-69%: Ability to create and animate complex 2D objects and characters within
  a scene to tell a story.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level.'
