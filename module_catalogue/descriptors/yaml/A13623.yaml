aim: This module provides the essentials of computer security. Topics covered include
  the various security threats and vulnerabilities and the services available to address
  these threats. Cryptographic foundations that underpin many security mechanisms
  are covered. Issues relating to network and application security, including web
  applications, are also explored. Best practice in secure programming is also covered.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe key network and system security technologies. Unable to
  distinguish between different types of application vulnerabilities or present instances
  of them in a clear manner. Unable to effectively use relevant tools.'
- '40%-49%: Can describe in detail key security threats and technologies. Can carry
  out basic configuration of technologies to implement security policies. Able to
  present instances of vulnerabilities and carry out threat modelling on a basic system.'
- '50%-59%: In addition to the above, can reason about the various approaches to security
  and their benefits and limitations. Able to explain in context and present instances
  of web application vulnerabilities. Able to model threats in a software system with
  multiple usage scenarios and actors.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, can explain basis of a variety of cryptographic schemes.
  Can competently make use of security tools and technologies and carry out effective
  penetration tests. Able to present and explain how to address web application vulnerabilities.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent level. Can demonstrate an understanding
  of some the trade-offs involved in providing security. Able to demonstrate in detail
  how to address web application vulnerabilities.'
