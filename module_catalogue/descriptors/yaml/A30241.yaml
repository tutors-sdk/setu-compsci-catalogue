aim: This module provides students with a solid grounding in applied data ethics by
  considering the ethical and legal challenges surrounding contemporary data acquisition,
  governance and analytic practices.
assessment criteria:

  simple data analytic scenarios, or demonstrate a basic understanding of pertinent
  ethical theory and terminology.'
- '40-49%: Able to identify, and cogently describe, the ethical challenges posed by
  simple data analytic scenarios, and demonstrate a basic understanding of pertinent
  ethical theory and terminology.'
- '50-59%: Able to identify, and cogently describe, the ethical and legal challenges
  posed by simple data analytic scenarios, and demonstrate a good understanding of
  pertinent ethical theory and terminology.'

  posed by complex data analytic scenarios, and demonstrate a good understanding of
  pertinent ethical theory and terminology.'
- '70-100%: Able to identify, cogently describe, and critique the ethical and legal
  challenges posed by complex and nuanced data analytic scenarios, demonstrate an
  excellent understanding of pertinent ethical theory and terminology, and create
