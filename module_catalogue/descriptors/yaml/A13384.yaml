aim: User Experience (UX) is a concept that has many dimensions, and it includes a
  variety of different disciplines?such as interaction design, information architecture,
  visual design, usability, and human-computer interaction. The aim of this module
  is for the students to learn, through information, demonstration, exploration and
  application, a human-centred approach to design and evaluation of a wide range of
  interactive systems and products, and their contexts of use.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domain(s).'
- '40%-59%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domain(s). Be able to discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge domain and
  ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
