aim: The Internet of Things(IoT) encompasses a broad range and scale of devices and
  applications. This module examines the protocols and standards used to interconnect
  the various devices and applications in the Internet of Things. Students will cover
  range of topics across the IoT protocol stack, including emerging networking protocols
  and architectures, messaging, programming abstractions, and applications.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to explain the characteristics and uses of IoT protocols and standards;
  unable to apply or implement IoT communication protocols.
- 40%-49%:Be able to describe specific IoT protocols and their applications. Able
  to successfully implement single IoT protocols.
- 50%-59%:Able to design and implement a multi-protocol IoT solution. Able to discuss,
  with sufficient knowledge, the relative merits of IoT protocol stack technologies
  and solutions.
- 60%-69%:Be able to create suitably complex IoT protocol solutions involving heterogeneous
  environments and devices. This is complemented with the knowledge to select and
  implement suitable technologies at all layers of the protocol stack.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.
