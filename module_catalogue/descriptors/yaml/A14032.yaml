aim: This module aims to provide students with the skills to uncover information that
  is found in mobile digital devices. Such devices may include phones, tablets, IoT
  devices, medical devices, automotive systems. These devices can hold vast amounts
  of data that can be used in a multitude of environments to recreate a persons movements
  in online and real world environments.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to perform investigations of mobile digital devices.'
- '40%-49%: Able to perform basic tasks of digital investigations relating to mobile
  devices.'
- '50%-59%: All of the above and in addition can reason as to the benefits/limitations
  of surrounding technologies. Can use tools to analyse different data sources associated
  with mobile devices.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, be capable of discussing the relative merits of associated
  technologies.'
- '70%-100%: All above to an excellent level. Be able to critically review new and
  emerging technologies and tools. Be able to discuss their effect on forensic examinations.'
