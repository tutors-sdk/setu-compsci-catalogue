aim: This module introduces technologies and network protocols that underpin computer
  systems. Topics covered include core operating system functions such as process,
  memory and file management as well as an introduction to distributed systems and
  virtualisation. These core principles are then built on to explore key aspects of
  computer systems such as device interfacing, short range and low powered wireless
  protocols and higher level messaging protocols. There is an emphasis on applied
  exercises using physical prototyping devices, command line tools and scripting.
assessment criteria:
- '<40% - Fail: Cannot represent the conceptual design of the system components presented
  in class or explain operation principles at a basic level. Unable to describe the
  major functions and operation of a Computer Network. Poor understanding of role
  of communications protocols in computer networks.'
- '40-49% - Pass: Knows the role of each component addressed by the learning outcomes
  and can represent their conceptual design, supported with a basic narrative description
  of the operation principles.Can describe TCP/IP and Internet Protocol Suite. Can
  provide overview of main computer network components and protocols.'
- '50-59% - 2.2: As well as a clear understanding of the components'' operation principles,
  can describe some of the design alternatives covered in the lectures, showing awareness
  for some of their strengths and weaknesses. Can describe in detail the data encapsulation
  process. Demonstrate an understanding of basic LAN implementation.'
- '60-69% - 2.1: Can demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the material covered
  in the lectures. In addition, be able to design and demonstrate a network solution
  including LAN and PAN components.'
- '70 - 100% - 1: Excellent understanding of the presented material and displays value
  added knowledge as a result of independent learning. Be able to analyse and design
  solutions to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems
  through the use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and computer-based practicals.
  The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and to underpin their related
  concepts. The lectures will use case studies as techniques for learning new skills.The
  practical element will provide the student with the skills, confidence and enthusiasm
  to be able to apply and reinforce skills learned.A student should be able to demonstrate
  use of social networking platforms as a form of online interaction
- This module adopts a hands-on practical approach with weekly laboratories that make
  use of computing devices, virtualisation and cloud-based platforms
- Self directed learning
