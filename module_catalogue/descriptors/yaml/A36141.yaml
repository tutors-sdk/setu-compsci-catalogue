aim: This module will facilitate the student to understand the application of NoSQL
  databases in organisations and gain knowledge and practical experience that enables
  them to analyse, design and construct complex NoSQL database solutions to handle
  large volumes of either structured, semi structured or unstructured data. The student
  will gain competence about NoSQL databases and be able to exercise judgments in
  using different types in a centralised or distributed manner to solve problems.
  Specifically, the student will be introduced to the concepts of CAP, Sharding and
  Replication and be able to independently appraise their relevance and application
  in regard to NoSQL database development.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret, describe and apply key concepts of NoSQL database solutions.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret, describe and apply key concepts of NoSQL database
  solutions.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of design and implementation of NoSQL
  database solutions and ability to integrate related knowledge in a realistic NOSQL
  implementation.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve complex problems within the design and implementation
  of NoSQL database solutions by experimenting and applying the appropriate skills
  and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills, tools and techniques'

indicative content:
- Emergence & Drivers of NoSQL databases
- NoSQL Database Concepts & Document Oriented Modelling Techniques
- 'Types of NoSQL Databases: Key-value databases, Document databases, Column family
  databases and Graph databases'
- CAP Theorem
- Data Persistence, Database Consistency and Replication
- Distribution of data and functionality
- NoSQL Database Sharding techniques & Strategies
learning and teaching methods:
- The lectures will introduce the theory content to the student. The student will
  be encouraged to participate in class discussions and ask questions to support their
  learning process.
- The practical classes facilitate the student in implementing the theory learned
  in the lectures.
- The continuous assessment will require the student to apply the theory and practical
  knowledge gained in the lectures and practicals to design, develop fully operational
  NoSQL database solution to a new business scenario or problem.
