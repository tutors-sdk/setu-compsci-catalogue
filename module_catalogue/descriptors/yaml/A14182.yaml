aim: Industrial Automation Systems are pervasive in the Manufacturing and Service
  Industries. Systems vary from small turn-key systems to large integrated systems
  complete with Supervisory Control and Data acquisition/analysis. In this module,
  students will use industry-standard industrial controllers, networking and User-Interface
  technologies required to develop Automated Systems. Safety considerations will also
  be covered.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to demonstrate simple software and hardware designs from user requirements.'
- '40%-49%: Able to specify interfacing and software requirements for simple discrete
  control systems.'
- '50%-59%: In addition, be able to implement industrial controller based solutions
  for simple discrete control systems.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, be able to develop optimised designs for a specific industrial
  control system.'
- '70%-100%: In addition, combine self-directed research of Industrial Automation
  Systems in assessment work. Exhibit the ability to solve unforeseen problems through
  the use and modification of self-learned skills and tools.'
