aim: This module addresses the analysis and design of business processes. The module
  places emphasis on the role of information and information systems in business processes.
  The module introduces the student to modelling techniques for representing business
  process. It addresses methods to support the analysis and design of business processes
  and techniques for measuring the performance level of processes. The module includes
  techniques associated with lean and six-sigma approaches to process improvement.
