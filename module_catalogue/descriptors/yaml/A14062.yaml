aim: The key success factors associated with the effective design, development, deployment
  and use of advanced digital information technologies are primarily non-technical,
  human factors associated with complexity in either the systems that are needed,
  the context in which the system is being deployed, or both. When not addressed these
  factors impinge upon both technical development activities and systems management
  processes in unexpected ways and often contribute to high levels of systems failure
  or result in systems which fail to meet their objectives. The challenge for systems
  professionals is to design and use systems development methodologies that create
  viable, effective, sustainable systems that support modern organisations and their
  decision making processes in all their complexity. This course reviews key success
  factors in systems development and recognises that the successful deployment of
  information systems in the enterprise requires a holistic approach to systems design,
  delivery and management which recognises how people, organisation and technology
  can be combined to create effective systems for decision making and other management
  functions.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to explain the fundamentals of applied systems thinking. Inability
  to demonstrate a rudimentary understanding of basic concepts associated with systems
  development or provide a rudimentary assessment of approaches to solving issues
  in ISD. Inability to demonstrate the capacity to personally reflect on their learning
  and its implications for them as systems professionals or in a similar sphere.'
- '40%-59%: Demonstrate an understanding of human-centred systems development approaches.
  Understand the characteristics of the various techniques and theories presented
  in the course, and be able to practically apply these in context. Be able to reflect
  on own learning experience to a basic level but not necessarily with deep insight.'
- '60%-69%: All of the above and in addition being able to apply the approaches to
  complex problems. Demonstrate ability to critically apply major frameworks presented
  in this module, and how these can be utilised and tailored to address a wide range
  of specific problems in systems engineering management. Be able to critically reflect
  on own learning experience with some deep insights.'
- '70%-100%: The above to excellent level. Be able to critically assess the strengths
  and limitations of particular methods associated with developing systems in that
  context. Be able to assess trends in the field of information systems development
  and how HCS approaches address these trends. Demonstrate a deep level of critical
  refelction on the theories, methods and praxis presented in this module.'

indicative content:
- Introduction to Important Ideas in Systems Theory and Cybernetics
- Complexity Theory and the challenges of complex systems for systems professionals
  and research
- Critical assessment of alternative information systems development paradigms and
  approaches
- 'Applied Systems Thinking and Practice: practical guidelines and techniques for
  developing human-centred information systems; addressing complexity, uncertainty
  and ambiguity; design of appropriate systems evaluation metrics; crafting advanced
  applied systems methodologies'
- Case Studies of complex information systems development and applications
learning and teaching methods:
- The course is designed to inculcate in students a deep appreciation and understanding
  of applied systems thinking and how it can be deployed in a variety of situations
  which systems professionals are likely to encounter either in research or practice.
- Academic readings and practical reports will be prepared and provided for students
  as part of the course readings materials.
- This course will combine presentation of important theories with a range of practical
  working activities which explore and unpack the implications of those theories for
  computer science, information systems and the work of systems professionals and
  research.
- Key delivery modes will include lectures, group work, practical sessions and workshops.
  Case studies and other non-didactic methods will be used in delivery.
- The practical programme will include seminar and workshop sessions e.g. exchange
  of ideas, methods workshops, portfolio preparations, case study work of systems
  development situations which will be explored in class.
- Students will submit a portfolio-type report comprising the various activities completed
  during the course for continuous assessment.
