aim: This module will introduce the student to the principles and practice of designing
  database solutions for large volumes of either structured or unstructured data.
  The student will gain competence in determining the suitability of a schemaless
  database or a data warehouse. The student will be introduced to the concepts of
  data persistence, consistency and distribution in the NoSQL database context. They
  will gain experience in the design and implementation of a NoSQL database system
  for unstructured data. The module will also introduce them to the use of data warehouses
  for storage of large volumes of structured data.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of Big Data database solutions.
- 40%-49%:Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of Big Data database solutions.
- 50%-59%:Ability to discuss key concepts of design and implementation of Big Data
  database solutions and ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other
  knowledge domains.
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve problems within the design and implementation of Big Data
  database solutions by experimenting with the appropriate skills and tools.
- 70%-100%:ll the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.

indicative content:
- Introduction to storing large volumes of structured or unstructured data
- Emergence of NoSQL databases
- Aggregate data models
- Key-value databases, document databases, column family databases and graph databases
- Data persistence, database consistency (CAP theorem, version stamps) and distribution
  of data storage
- Fundamentals involved in the storage of large volumes of structured data in a data
  warehouse
learning and teaching methods:
- The lectures will introduce the theory content to the student. The student will
  be encouraged to participate in class discussions and ask questions to support their
  learning process.
- The practical classes facilitate the student in implementing the theory learned
  in the lectures.
- The continuous assessment will require the student to apply the theory and practical
  knowledge to a new business scenario.
