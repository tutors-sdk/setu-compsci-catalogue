aim: This module provides students with a solid grounding in the area of computer
  and information security. The question of securing modern distributed applications
  is treated holistically, where students assess security threats and vulnerabilities
  at different layers and identify suitable services and technologies to help address
  these threats. Cryptographic foundations that underpin many security mechanisms
  are covered in some detail, as well as best practices in secure software development.
  Students will also discuss incident handling and a selection of techniques and tools
  for forensic investigations.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domains
  of computer security.'
- '40%-59%: Able to interpret, describe and discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domains of computer security. Able to discover and integrate related knowledge to
  assess and implement security approaches.'
- '60%-69%: Able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domains by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to propose solutions to
  a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
