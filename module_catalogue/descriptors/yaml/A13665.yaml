aim: Data analytics supports critical decision making in business. It helps to create
  new knowledge and to draw conclusions on existing models or theories. This module
  introduces the learner to the fundamental concepts of data analytics. These concepts
  include; data identification, cleaning, transforming and modelling data for the
  purpose of analysing and manipulating data to discover relevant information to support
  decision making. The student will also be introduced to advanced analytics such
  as prediction, data mining and Big Data.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domain(s).'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domain(s).'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge domain and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
