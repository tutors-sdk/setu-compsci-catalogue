aim: This module provides the foundation for advanced animation construction and integration
  with external media, as well as techniques to automate and optimize development
  processes. Students will learn advanced rigging and animation techniques such as
  Facial Animation, Visual Effects and Motion Capture. In addition, students will
  be introduced to productivity, management and optimization techniques using asset
  management services, scripting and expressions.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and implement fundamental concepts and practices for
  advanced animation and customized tool development.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and implement fundamental concepts and practices
  for advanced animation and customized tool development.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to interpret and implement concepts and pipeline services that
  integrate relevant 3D Assets across a range of transmedia platforms.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to analyse, manage and design solutions to a high standard for
  a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the use and modification
  of appropriate asset management skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level.'
