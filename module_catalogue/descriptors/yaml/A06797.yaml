aim: This module introduces students to data analysis techniques in statistics, regression
  and financial maths. The module will focus on the application of data analysis techniques
  along with interpretation of data analysis results. Practical labs will be included
  to introduce more advanced statistical features.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key statistical concepts.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key statistical concepts.'
- '50%-59%: Be able to discuss key statistical concepts and to discover and integrate
  related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve statistical problems using appropriate statistical tools.'
- '70%-100%: Be able to analyse and design solutions to a high standard for a range
  of both complex and unforeseen problems through the use and modification of statistical
  skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and computer-based practical
  labs.
- The practical labs will be used to support lectures by providing students with tools
  for modelling real world problems.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts.
- The tutorials will provide a forum through which the student will rehearse/refine
  new concepts introduced in lectures.
