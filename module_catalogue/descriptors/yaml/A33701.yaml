aim: This module introduces the student to the practice of data science, where techniques
  and algorithms from mathematics and statistics, supplemented with advanced data
  infrastructures and processes, are used to learn from data. In this context, learning
  includes understanding and prediction, and the data might not have been collected
  for the purpose of such analysis. The student will be introduced to the machine
  learning pipeline, which provides a principled, mathematically rigorous way to build
  data science models. With these models, and the solution algorithms covered in the
  module, the student can extract understanding and knowledge from the data. The practical
  part of the module will present a suite of machine learning exercises that the student
  will complete by building data science models, making predictions, validating those
  predictions, and interpreting the results.

learning and teaching methods:
- The lectures will introduce data science theory and practice to the student. The
  student will be encouraged to participate in class discussions and ask questions
  to support their learning process.
- The practical classes extend the lectures by showing data science in action and
  encouraging the student to use and extend the concepts.
- Students will apply typical machine learning methods to data sets provided in the
  practical classes.
- Students will interpret and present, in context, the findings produced in the practical
  classes and continuous assessment.
