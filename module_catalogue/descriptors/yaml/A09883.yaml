aim: This module is designed to introduce the computing student to the mechanics,
  electricity, light and measurement principles that they are likely to encounter
  in their computing course. It assumes no prior knowledge of physics. There will
  be an emphasis on problem-solving and laboratory-based teaching throughout. Each
  element of the syllabus is supported by suitable experiments, which will develop
  the students experimental skills and understanding of measurement and associated
  uncertainties.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: The student has failed to demonstrate a reasonable grasp of mechanics, electricity,
  light and measurement and is unable to carry out routine calculations reliably.
  Experimental work is generally poor.'
- '40%-49%: Able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the mechanics, electricity,
  light and measurement principles covered. Able to provide partial solutions to numerical
  problems. Practical work reaches an acceptable level.'
- '50%-59%: Able to clearly describe and define basics concepts in mechanics, electricity,
  light and measurement. Able to analyse physical situations and apply suitable problem-solving
  techniques to find numerical solutions. Practical work is performed and reported
  on in a capable manner.'
- '60%-69%: In addition to the above, able to apply problem-solving techniques to
  new similar problems. Demonstrates a good understanding of the majority of the course
  content. Good, clear reporting of practical work.'
- '70%-100%: All the previous to an excellent level. Demonstrates an ability to put
  a numerical solution into a context and assess whether such solutions are meaningful.
  Can critically assess experiments undertaken.'
