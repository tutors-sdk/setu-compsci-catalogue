aim: This module will introduce the student to the principles and practice of designing
  and implementing relational database systems. The student will gain competence in
  Entity Relationship modelling and normalisation techniques. The student will be
  introduced to the concepts of data persistence, consistency and distribution in
  the relational database context. They will gain experience in the design and implementation
  of a practical relational database system.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of relational database systems.
- 40%-49%:Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of relational database systems.
- 50%-59%:Ability to discuss key concepts of the analysis, design and implementation
  of relational database systems and ability to discover and integrate related knowledge
  in other knowledge domains.
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve problems within the design and implementation of relational
  database systems by experimenting with the appropriate skills and tools.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.
