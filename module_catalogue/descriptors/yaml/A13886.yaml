aim: To enhance the student?s existing IT knowledge and experience with the skills-set
  and knowledge required to design, develop and deploy full-stack enterprise web applications
  using a range of modern platforms and tools. The module will also address foundation-level
  material in web architecture, object-oriented programming, design representation
  and relevant design patterns. In addition, the concepts and vocabulary surrounding
  the topics covered will enable the student to communicate and participate more effectively
  as a non-technical member (e.g. business analyst) of a software development team.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and apply key concepts of enterprise web app development.'
- '40%-59%: Demonstrate competency in the tool suite and an ability to develop small-scale
  enterprise web solution.'
- '60%-69%: Presents implemented solution to a medium-sized problem that demonstrate
  an excellent understanding of the main patterns and practices of enterprise web
  app design.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent standard, and incorporates self-directed
  investigation into state-of-the-art enterprise web technology.'
