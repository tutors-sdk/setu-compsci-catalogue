aim: This module will offer the student a process and tools to access the business
  visibility of a technical idea, and to develop the best business approach for commercialisation.
  This will be a 'hands on' class in which students will exercise commercialisation
  concepts on patents and develop technology commercialisation plan with real world
  business application.
