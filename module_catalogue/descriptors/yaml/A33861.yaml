aim: XML is one of the most popular industry formats for business document publishing,
  web application development and digital content management. It is also a critical
  part of the web environment and web standard stacks and is the basis for emerging
  next-generation document, web, and e-business application strategies. This course
  focuses upon providing the student with an understanding of the XML standard syntax
  and related standards and how these can be used to build enterprise applications.
  This course also focuses on related standards for interoperability and automated
  enterprise information such as JavasScript Object Notation (JSON) and APIs.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and describe key concepts related to XML and JSON and its
  applications.
- 40%-49%:Ability to interpret and describe key concepts of XML and JSON and their
  applications.
- 50%-59%:Ability to discuss key concepts associated with XML and its applications
  combined with an ability to discover and integrate related ideas (such as important
  applications of XML).
- 60%-69%:Ability to independently solve problems associated with authoring XML and
  applying XML in various contexts including experimentation with the appropriate
  skills and tools and/or external references not explicitly offered in the course
  materials and/or rework these references in new ways.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level including an ability to analyse and
  design XML applications to a high standard. Demonstrate a high level of appreciation
  of how XML applications and related-standards interplay with other aspects of web
  systems, including those not explicitly stated in the course materials or a reworking
  of course material references in new way(s).
