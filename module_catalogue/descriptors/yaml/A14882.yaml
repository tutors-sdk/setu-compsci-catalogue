aim: This module gives the student experience in developing a computing-related project
  based on the work the student has done in Project 1, semester 7. The student will
  present their work at the end of the module by submitting a final report, in addition
  to a poster, a short video, and a presentation/demonstration.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Failure to incorporate feedback. Failure to competently demonstrate understanding
  of work.'
- '40%-49%: Produces prototype to minimum requirements. Produces full et of documentation.
  Able to demonstrate own work in competent manner.'
- '50%-59%: As above and produces working, tested system to most requirements (unless
  failure to do so is justified). Documentation and reports are clear and of good
  quality. Comprehensive knowledge of tools and technologies.'
- '60%-69%: As above and requirements fully met unless failure to do so is justified.
  Demonstrates ability to solve unfamiliar technical problems. Shows good judgement
  in technology selection. Documentation shows evidence of ability to see limitations
  or potential in approaches used.'
- '70%-100%: As above and produces an excellent, professional calibre stand-alone
  system with equally excellent documentation. Demonstrates ability to abstract ideas
  and reflect on the process.'

indicative content:
- Incorporate feedback from project supervisors/examiners, relating to the work done
  in Semester 1, namely high level analysis and design and the construction of prototypes
  and/or early iterations
- Develop further and document a testing strategy to ensure the quality of each software
  module, each production-quality iteration and of the final product
- Develop the student's ability to write referenced academic and technical reports,
  principally a required final report, not less than 2000 words and not more than
  4000 words, accompanied by a poster and a video
- To provide the student with the opportunity (and requirement) to meet with a supervisor
  week by week and to complete the work according to the initial or a revised plan
- To enable the student to apply their problem-solving and their technical skills
  to address implementation issues as they arise
learning and teaching methods:
- Weekly meetings with project supervisors
- Self-directed learning using library and Internet sources
- Prototype with different scenarios to identify best practice

learning outcomes:
- Intergrate feedback from Project 1.
- Revise the project plan to reflect a more mature understanding of the problem area.
- Create a prototype based on a specification and chosen development methodology.
- Reflect on limitations and potential of the chosen methodology and tools and technologies.
- Validate the final system, with accompanying report, video and poster and competently
  discuss the problem area.
