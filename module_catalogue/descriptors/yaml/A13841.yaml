aim: This module introduces the student to the principles of good design for web interfaces.
  These principles are grounded in Cognitive Science and HCI (Human Computer Interaction)
  theories. Web Design introduces the student to the basic principles and development
  of web based applications, and examines related web accessibility guidelines. The
  student will become competent in raw HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading
  Style Sheets), demonstrated by the creation of a simple interactive website.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts that relate to HCI and Web
  Design.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts that relate to HCI and
  Web Design.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts that relate to HCI and Web Design and
  ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems that relate to HCI and Web Design by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse HCI and Web Design
  solutions to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems
  through the use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
