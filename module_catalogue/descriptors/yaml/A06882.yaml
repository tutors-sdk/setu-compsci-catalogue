aim: This module teaches the fundamentals of sound, sound recording and multi-track
  sound editing using timeline based tools. A large emphasis is placed on practical
  work - recording, editing, and mixing. Audio productions are created for use in
  media applications & trans-coded for delivery on multiple platforms.

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be characterised by student participation in both formal theoretical
  and practical/studio classroom activities in which students learn theoretical concepts
  and apply them immediately using dedicated hardware and software.
- Self-directed learning.
- Studio Classes will be delivered in two 2-hour blocks.
- Computer based assessment.
- Innovative pedagogical techniques (e.g. video, LMS, peer review, discussion forum,
  collaborative group work, flipped classroom, dynamic assessment, event based learning).
- Apple mac computer lab with relevant hardware & software (kept up to date at least
  annually e.g. GarageBand, Adobe Audition, Ableton Live).
- Accessible, professional sound proofed recording studios with professional microphones
  and audio workstations (Vibe FM studios).
