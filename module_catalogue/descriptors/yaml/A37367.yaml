aim: The purpose is to advance the students skills in conducting business analytics
  on structured data and to introduce the student to the analysis conducted on unstructured
  data. Students will investigate data mining techniques such as predicting customer
  behaviour, performance management, simulation and optimisation of business processes.
  The student will conduct analysis to discover patterns and to predict future events
  or outcomes. The student will be introduced to the analysis of unstructured data
  such as text and web mining.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the Business Analytics domain.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the Business Analytics
  domain, particularly advanced data mining techniques.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the advanced data mining techniques
  and ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve advanced business analytics problems by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- Lectures will introduce the fundamentals and concepts in the area. Labs will implement
  those concepts using data sets.
- In the labs, the student will prepare the data, perform analysis, evaluate the results
  and report on the findings.
- In the continuous assessment the student will apply what they have learned in the
  labs and lectures to a new data set within a business context.
