aim: This module aims to enable students to gain a detailed knowledge and understanding
  of the Irish Legal System along with a clear and concise account of the fundamental
  principles of computer forensics law. As part of their studies, students will gain
  a detailed knowledge and understanding of the general principles of many diverse
  areas of law that apply to computer forensics. Students will gain a detailed knowledge
  of Criminal Law, especially as it relates to Computer Forensics. The various computer
  based criminal offences pursuant to legislation will be analysed. This module will
  also aim to enable students to study and demonstrate competence in the relevant
  rules of evidence with particular emphasis on gathering electronic evidence. The
  use and admissibility of electronic evidence in proceedings. The legal responsibilities
