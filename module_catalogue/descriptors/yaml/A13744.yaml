aim: This module provides the essentials of computer security and forensics. Topics
  covered include various security threats and vulnerabilities and the services available
  to address these threats. Cryptographic foundations that underpin many security
  mechanisms are covered. Issues relating to network and application security, including
  web applications, are also explored. Best practice in secure programming is also
  covered. Students will explore the area of digital forensics through file system
  forensics, network/online forensics and media forensics.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe key network and system security technologies. Unable to
  distinguish between different types of application vulnerabilities or present instances
  of them in a clear manner. Unable to effectively use relevant tools. Unable to differentiate
  stages of the forensic process.'
- '40%-49%: Can describe in detail key security threats and technologies. Can carry
  out basic configuration of technologies to implement security policies. Able to
  present instances of vulnerabilities and carry out threat modelling on a basic system.
  Can conduct basic computer forensic investigations.'
- '50%-59%: In addition to the above, can reason about the various approaches to security
  and their benefits and limitations. Able to explain in context and present instances
  of web application vulnerabilities. Able to model threats in a software system with
  multiple usage scenarios and actors. Can conduct computer forensic investigations
  and recover deleted data.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, can explain basis of a variety of cryptographic schemes.
  Can competently make use of security tools and technologies and carry out effective
  penetration tests. Able to present and explain how to address web application vulnerabilities.
  Can interpret evidence extracted during a forensic investigation and corroborate
  it with other sources of evidence.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent level. Can demonstrate an understanding
  of some the trade-offs involved in providing security. Able to demonstrate in detail
  how to address web application vulnerabilities. Can evaluate the appropriateness
  of different forensic tools and approaches.'
