aim: This module serves as an introduction to 3D modelling for game asset designers
  and comprises an emphasis on the modelling pipeline, from concept to model creation
  to rigging and skinning, and techniques used for the exporting of 3D models to be
  used in a game engine.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to identify and navigate the main components of a 3D production
  software platform. Inability to critically evaluate techniques used in the creation
  and exporting of 3D computer graphics models.'
- '40%-49%: Ability to identify and navigate the main components of a 3D production
  software platform. Ability to describe key concepts of the 3D modelling pipeline
  and techniques used for exporting.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss and critically evaluate key concepts of the 3D modelling
  pipeline and techniques used for exporting.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the framework of the 3D modelling pipeline
  by experimenting with appropriate skills and tools of the 3D production software.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of problems through the use and modification of appropriate
  skills and tools of the 3D production software.'
