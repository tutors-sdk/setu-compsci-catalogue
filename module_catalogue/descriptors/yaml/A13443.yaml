aim: This module introduces students to the main topics of Systems Analysis, Design
  and Testing. Systems must be planned in order that all interested parties can review
  and understand the necessary system objectives. This module will introduce the student
  to the problems associated with the development of software systems; they should
  appreciate the problems associated with developing software systems, and techniques
  that can overcome some of these problems. During this module the student will be
  exposed to various lifecycles. Appropriate CASE tools will be applied throughout
  the module.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domain(s).'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domain(s).'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge domain and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

- The Development Process
- Roles involved in the development process
- Planning & Requirements
- Analysis & Design
- Testing
- Implementation
- Post Implementation
learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and a computer-based
  practical.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts. The
  student will be encouraged to manage their own.
- Learning by asking questions and entering class discussions.
- In practical classes the student will be presented with problems similar to those
  presented in lectures. The aim of the practicals is to provide the student with
  the skills and confidence to apply what has been demonstrated and learned.
