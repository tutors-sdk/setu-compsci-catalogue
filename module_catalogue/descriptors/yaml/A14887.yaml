aim: Students will spend a period of not less than four months in a work experience
  position in an ICT and Software Development workplace. The placement allows the
  student to gain a structured introduction to the work practices, requirements and
  procedures of the industry. Students will have the opportunity to consolidate, develop
  and enhance their learning experience through the practical application knowledge,
  skills and competencies acquired on the academic to the analysis and creation of
  solutions to workplace problems through a structured programme of work agreed the
  during the studio phase. This will ensure students have a clear focus and their
  supervision has a specific context. As the project will be graded, students will
  have access to an academic project supervisor during the placement period.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: The student has failed to meet the criteria for a pass, but has not submitted
  a project which can demonstrate a reasonable grasp of the fundamentals of the chosen
  project area.'
- '40%-49%: The student has met the criteria for a pass, and demonstrates a reasonable
  grasp of the fundamentals of the chosen project. Typically a project more supervisor-driven
  than student-led. The project is unlikely to be the basis for a portfolio.'
- '50%-59%: A solid performance though notably stronger in some respects than others.
  A good standard of report but neither technically outstanding nor grounded in deep
  understanding of the relevant technology/domain. Sound but unremarkable. Would require
  significant additional effort in order to be a strong constituent in a portfolio.
  However, the student has the abilities to take it to this level, perhaps with additional
  supervision / advice from domain experts.'
- '60%-69%: A student in this band will have shown a high level of independence in
  the conduct of the project and technical competence in any practical work undertaken.
  A strong performance may have been achieved in all components of assessment. However
  some aspects of the project would require some additional attention before publication
  on a portfolio that would do justice to the student''s skills and abilities.'
- '70%-100%: A mark in this band indicates a distinction. A non-trivial project has
  been executed and the resulting report + implementation (if appropriate) is an exemplary
  representation of the students skill and abilities. The material produced will serve
  as a strong demonstrator and / or portfolio highly relevant future employers in
  assessing the suitability of the student for recruitment. It can be directly incorporated
  into such a portfolio, perhaps with minor modifications.'
