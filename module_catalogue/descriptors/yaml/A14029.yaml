aim: XML is one of the most popular industry formats for business document publishing,
  web application development and digital content management. It is also a critical
  part of the web environment and web standard stacks and is the basis for emerging
  next-generation document, web, and e-business application strategies. This course
  focuses upon providing the student with an understanding of the XML standard syntax
  and related standards and how these can be used to build enterprise applications.
  Important standards associated with XML, including machine-readable business information
  standards which support, for example, automatic data interchange (for electronic
  business data sharing in EDI) are also introduced. XML documents support business
  intelligence and other architectures and infrastructures, as well as a variety of
  content management systems and processes and the student is introduced to these
  applications. XML also provides important web data management capabilities to firms
  which are covered here. Finally, as a data interchange standard on the web XML provides
  a basis for governance and regulation in the e-business context.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and describe key concepts related to XML and its applications.
- 40%-49%:Ability to interpret and describe key concepts of XML and its applications.
- 50%-59%:Ability to discuss key concepts associated with XML and its applications
  combined with an ability to discover and integrate related ideas (such as important
  applications of XML).
- 60%-69%:Ability to independently solve problems associated with authoring XML and
  applying XML in various contexts including experimentation with the appropriate
  skills and tools and/or external references not explicitly offered in the course
  materials and/or rework these references in new ways. An ability to reflect upon
  one's own learning and apply it in real or relevant imagined contexts.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level including an ability to analyse and
  design XML applications to a high standard. Demonstrate a high level of appreciation
  of how XML applications and related-standards interplay with other aspects of web
  systems, including those not explicitly stated in the course materials or a reworking
  of course material references in new way(s). Reflective learning demonstrating a
  deep understanding of the course materials.
