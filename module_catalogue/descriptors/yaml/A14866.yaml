aim: This module gives the student experience in developing a computing-related project
  by undertaking research, based on the work the student has completed in Project
  1, semester 7. The student will present their work at the end of the module by submitting
  a dissertation, in addition to a poster, a short video, and a presentation.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Failure to incorporate feedback. Failure to competently demonstrate an understanding
  of research and proceed to an adequate level.'
- '40%-49%: Produces a basic research dissertation with basic documentation complete.'
- '50%-59%: As above and produces a dissertation meeting most of the objectives (unless
  failure to do so is justified). Documentation and reports are clear and of good
  quality. Comprehensive knowledge of research area.'
- '60%-69%: As above and requirements fully met in an adequate manner. Demonstration
  shows evidence of ability to see limitations or potential in approaches used.'
- '70%-100%: As above and produces an excellent, professional calibre stand-alone,
  robust and thorough piece of research with equally excellent documentation/dissertation.
  Demonstrates ability to abstract ideas and reflect on the research process.'

indicative content:
- Incorporate feedback from project supervisors/examiners, relating to the work done
  in Semester 1, that work being a literature review and consequent formulation of
  research question(s), and initial investigative work on appropriate research methodologies,
  including data gathering strategies.
- Complete the consideration of the research methodologies to be used, and design
  of the data collection instruments.
- Complete the development of any customised software tools to be used in investigation
  or data gathering and analysis.
- Further develop the student's ability to write referenced academic and technical
  reports, principally a required final dissertation, not less than 6000 words and
  not more than 12000 words, accompanied by a poster and a video.
- To provide the student with the opportunity (and requirement) to meet with a supervisor
  week by week and to complete the work according to the initial or a revised plan.
- To enable the student to apply investigative, problem-solving and technical knowledge
  to address issues as they arise.
learning and teaching methods:
- Weekly meetings with project supervisor
- Self-directed learning using library and Internet sources
- Devising ways of testing research methodologies before using them.
