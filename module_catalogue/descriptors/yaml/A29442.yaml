aim: This module aims to build on the students undergraduate knowledge and introduce
  him / her to the state-of-the-art in convergent technologies for advanced bio-medical
  and electro-mechanical applications. A selection of convergent technologies for
  advanced bio-medical and electro-mechanical applications and industry roadmaps are
  presented and examined in the context of their associated regulatory frameworks.
