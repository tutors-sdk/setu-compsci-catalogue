aim: This module introduces the students to the most commonly used protocols and tools
  for implementing calibration and diagnostic functions on vehicle and motorsport
  control systems.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to describe the main characteristics of diagnostic protocols.'
- '40%-49%: Able to describe the basic features of diagnostic protocols and tools.'
- '50%-59%: All the above and in addition is able to describe the detailed protocols
  used for calibration and diagnostic services in automotive applications.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, is able to interpret diagnostic data to identify vehicle
  application problems.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above and in addition is able to design new diagnostic services.'

essential material:
- '"ASAM organisation." www.asam.net'
full title: Automotive Diagnostic Protocols
indicative content:
- Role of diagnostics in the vehicle and application lifecycle
- Vehicle diagnostics interface
- Diagnostic Trouble Codes and ECU Diagnostic memory (Black Box recording)
- Calibration protocol (XCP)
- ASAM diagnostic tool architecture
- Diagnostic protocol (ISO 15765)
- Diagnostic software tools
- Diagnostic data exchange standards
learning and teaching methods:
- Combination of lectures and lab-based practicals.
- The lectures will cover the theory and underlying technologies in diagnostic application
  development.
- The lab-based practicals, building on the theoretical knowledge from the lectures,
  provide the practical skills to develop diagnostic services for automotive applications.
- Students will be encouraged to enhance their lab work and assessment submissions
  using self-directed research and learning into broader automotive diagnostics topics.
