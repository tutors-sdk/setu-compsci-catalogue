aim: This subject is a formal induction into the research process. It provides a general
  overview of important concepts, methodologies and an introduction to practical methods
  associated with carrying out independent research in computing and information systems
  related topics. This course is designed to provide an understanding of the scientific
  research process. It also provides a practical support for students who are beginning
  their postgraduate research activities. Research in computing-related fields is
  one of the most inter-disciplinary and complex areas of academic activity ranging
  from highly technical studies to research on systems development methodologies to
  analysis of user experiences to large-scale systems integration and many other areas.
  This module therefore reflects the rich tradition of interdisciplinary and single
  disciplinary published research in the Department of Computing and Mathematics.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and describe key concepts associated with academic research.
  Unclear or entirely inadequate presentation of proposed research. Proposal not workable.
- 40%-59%:Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of scientific research. Some
  clarity in the research proposal but may need work to successfully progress their
  study. Research proposal deemed suitable for further work, with revisions and refocussing.
  Elementary plans in place which provide a solid basis for further work.
- 60%-69%:Solid grasp of conceptual material. Demonstrable understanding of and ability
  to articulate key concepts associated with research. Good quality research proposal
  and presentation, demonstrating a clear understanding of the domain and how to research
  it as an independent researcher.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level. Demonstrates an ability to analyse
  and design solutions to a high standard for a research project which clearly demonstrates
  publishable potential in a computing-related field. Clearly stated and well-worked
  theory with some appreciation of how to test this theory to a relatively advanced
  level.

indicative content:
- Overview of the classical scientific research process, introduction to important
  ideas in the philosophy of science
- Topic selection, problem formulation, setting out research study objectives, formulating
  different types of research questions, qualities of well-focused RQs
- 'Critiquing the academic literature: features and sources of academic publications,
  preparing the literature survey & review, referencing styles and conventions, the
  relationship between the literature review and research questions, the relationship
  between the literature review and theory development, important sources and types
  of academic publication, reviewing criteria for academic publications'
- 'Theory formulation: concepts & variables, propositions and hypotheses, building
  theoretical frameworks for validation and testing including deductive and inductive
  reasoning techniques'
- 'Research Design: fixed vs. flexible designs, Overview of Quantitative, Qualitative
  and Multi-method approaches in computing and experimental design'
- Quantitative methods in computing and IS including the principles of quantitative
  research, statistical inference, procuring data and designing experiments
- Qualitative methods in computing and IS including case study research, principles
  of data gathering, analysis and interpretation and other methods and their applications
  in computing and IS
- Ethical issues in computing-related research
- 'Qualities of a research proposal: Criteria of coherence, comprehensiveness and
  currency, originality, impact, validity, reliability, generalisability, significance,
  rigour and related epistemological considerations'
learning and teaching methods:
- Lectures, group work, practical sessions and workshops. Engagement with a dedicated,
  assigned research supervisor.
- Module delivery will combine workshop oriented approach with the presentation of
  theoretical material. It is designed to engage students in the work of preparing
  their research dissertation proposal and supporting engagement with supervisors
  and research planning.
- Continuous assessment of this module is by way of a dissertation proposal which
  comprises a report and presentation.
- This module will enable students to initiate and progress work on their dissertation
  proposal and presentation during the workshops.
- Indicative Dissertation Proposal Report Structure will be provided to students during
  the delivery of this module.The student will also make an oral presentation of the
  proposal to a research panel organised by the relevant course board.
- This proposal will be assessed using a dissertation proposal assessment form which
  will be reviewed during the module delivery. The assessment process will involve
  a first reader (the assigned supervisor) and a second reader.

learning outcomes:
- Appraise key research concepts associated with scientific research.
- Formulate their research problem, research objectives and research questions.
- Organise a preliminary literature review of the concepts comprising the research
  questions associated with a topic of research.
- Formulate original theory for testing and demonstrate clearly how they arise from
  the literature review and gather data to evaluate their theory through appropriate
  research method instrumentation alternatives.
- Prepare and successfully present a mini-dissertation research proposal to a research
  panel.
- Prepare and engage in a planned research activity under academic supervision.
- Collect and analyse quantitative and qualitative data to assist in addressing a
  research question.
