aim: This module aims to allow students to experience a particular area of volunteering
  in Irish community. Students will choose an area of volunteering which contributes
  to their personal and professional development. In conjunction with the practical
  aspect of volunteering, on successful completion of this module students will demonstrate
  the ability to self-manage, self-reflect, self-evaluate and respond to constructive
