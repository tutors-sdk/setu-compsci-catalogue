aim: Introduce the the student to the software development lifecycle via the implementation
  of a simple but functional web application. In doing this, analyse & model a constrained
  set of user requirements. Then design, build and deploy a simple web application.
  Incorporate basic database, session support & server side rendering.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret, describe or implement key components of a simple web
  application.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to construct a minimal web application, incorporating server side
  rendering.'
- '50%-59%: Design and implement a web application including basic database and session
  support.'
- '60%-69%: All of the above including a simple model of the application structure.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Incorporate Unit Tests for a specific
  subset of an application.'

learning and teaching methods:
- Lectures will introduce the general context of the curriculum, and explore specific
  topics in depth.
- Supervised, guided and scripted practicals will lead the student through the construction
  of selection of small applications, designed to illustrate key concepts covered
  in the lectures.
- Each practical will propose a set of exercises -- to be solved in a subsequent practical.
- Assignment One will focus on the enhancement of the guided application.
- Assessment Two will invite the student to analyse, design and implement a basic
  but functional new application.

learning outcomes:
- Identify the key components of a server rendered web application and incorporate
  them into a running application.
- Use Model View Controller & related patterns in the implementation of a web project.
- Relate the request/response lifecycle, routing & session management in the context
  of a modern application framework.
- Convert a set of requirements into a set of discrete stories and translate these
  stories into a simple project plan with associated timeline and testing strategy.
- Model the user requirements and realize the model in a simple database.
