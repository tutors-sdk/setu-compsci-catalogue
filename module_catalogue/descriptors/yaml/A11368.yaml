aim: This module introduces the student to the process of production-scale automotive
  software development, beginning with an overview of vehicle electronic architectures
  and the automotive software development lifecycle. A detailed technical examination
  of the AUTOSAR vehicle software architecture is presented and students will learn
  how to apply this to the development of automotive applications. Model Based Development
  and testing strategies are explored as a way of improving productivity and software
  quality. In practical laboratory work students will experience the use of advanced
  automotive software development and simulation tools.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Inability to specify a coherent application design.
- 40%-49%:Able to describe the basic software development technical concepts.
- 50%-59%:All the above and in addition is able demonstrate an understanding of the
  software development using industry tools and workflow.
- 60%-69%:In addition, is able to develop automotive software components according
  to the AUTOSAR specification.
- 70%-100%:All of the above and able to demonstrate a deep understanding of how quality
  assurance can be incorporated in to the development process.
