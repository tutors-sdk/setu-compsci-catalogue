aim: The student will be introduced to the fundamental concepts and techniques of
  Data Mining. The student will learn the data mining process and experience the steps
  involved; including data pre-processing, modelling, optimisation, result interpretation
  and validation. The student will learn and apply an appropriate methodology, tool
  or technology to datasets that support business intelligence applications.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe and apply key concepts of the data mining process.'
- '40%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the data mining process and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve data mining problems by applying each step in the data
  mining process.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
