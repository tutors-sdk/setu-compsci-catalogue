aim: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) assist and complement drivers in the
  safe and effective control of vehicles. In this module, students will use the industry-standard
  tools and technologies required to develop ADAS applications using vision/camera
  systems, sensor technology, in-vehicle data networks, and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)
  technology. Furthermore, students will learn how to model and simulate ADAS systems.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and appraise key characteristics and motivation for ADAS
  systems. Unable to design and simulate a basic ADAS solution.
- 40%-49%:Be able to interpret and appraise key ADAS technologies. Be able to design
  and simulate a basic ADAS solution.
- 50%-59%:In addition, be to design and implement a multi-modal ADAS solution. Able
  to appraise, with sufficient knowledge, the relative merits of ADAS technologies
  and solutions.
- 60%-69%:In addition, design and simulate complex ADAS solutions that incorporate
  Vehicle to Vehicle, optical and in-vehicle communication networks.
- '70%-100%: In addition to the above , combine self-directed research of state-of-the-art
  ADAS systems in assessment work. Exhibit the ability to solve unforeseen problems
  through the use and modification of self-learned skills and tools.'
