aim: This module will build on the material covered in the Cloud Computing 1 module
  to further explore the latest technologies in private Data Centers and Public Cloud
  Service providers. In particular Software Defined Networking environments and the
  automation and management of Cloud environments will be examined through practical
  lab exercises.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domains
  of SDN, Infrastructure services and automation.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domains of SDN, Infrastructure services and automation.'
