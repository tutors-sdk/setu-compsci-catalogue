aim: The focus of this module is on the principles and practices in the design and
  implementation of Cloud based applications and supporting services. This module
  will introduce modern application architectures and frameworks, RESTful services
  and Cloud Computing Infrastructure technologies. Emerging concepts and techniques
  in the areas of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS will be covered using the latest tools such
  as Amazon's Web Services.
