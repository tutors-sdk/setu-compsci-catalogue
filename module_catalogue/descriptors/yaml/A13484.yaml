aim: The aim of this module is to introduce the fundamental concepts in information
  theory, and to study common problems that arise in network theory using graphs/network
  models and neural network concepts.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to demonstrate knowledge or understanding of the fundamental concepts
  in network models, information theory and neural networks as outlined in the syllabus
  content, inability to apply concepts to selected problems.'
- '40%-49%: Able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts
  in network models, information theory and neural networks as outlined in syllabus
  content.'
- '50%-59%: In addition to above, able to find the complete solution set to basic
  problems, and in addition, able to supply a reasonable interpretation of generated
  results.'
- '60%-69%: All the above, in addition be able to independently determine appropriate
  mathematical techniques to analyse applied problems and to express their work with
  rigour and precision.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Demonstrates an ability to put a
  solution into a context and assess whether such solutions are meaningful.'

learning and teaching methods:
- The module is covered through a series of lectures supported by problem solving
  sessions and some directed independent learning.
- The lectures will develop theory, lead students through worked examples and introduce
  the context for the module material.
- The practical sessions will utilise existing software network libraries to solve
  selected problems using concepts covered in lectures.
- Active engagement with frequent practice on examples is strongly encouraged through
  regular course work consisting of a mixture of practical activities graded from
  guided to self-directed tasks.
