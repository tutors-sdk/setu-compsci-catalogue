aim: The module is designed to consolidate understanding of fundamental statistical
  concepts and extend knowledge and skills to probability, advanced regression techniques
  and inferential statistics. The student will see how these tools can be applied
  in an industry setting. Statistical software will be used as a modelling tool.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key statistical concepts.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key statistical concepts.'
- '50%-59%: Be able to discuss key statistical concepts and to discover and integrate
  related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve statistical problems using appropriate statistical tools.'
- '70%-100%: Be able to analyse and design solutions to a high standard for a range
  of both complex and unforeseen problems through the use and modification of statistical
  skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and computer-based practical
  labs.
- The practical labs will be used to support lectures by providing students with tools
  for modelling real world problems.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts.

learning outcomes:
- Apply probability principles and data distributions to evaluate quality control
  procedures.
- Distinguish between descriptive and inferential statistical quantities in data analytics.
- Apply a broad range of analytical statistical techniques and interpret these appropriately.
- Analyse patterns from intricate data sets.
- Assemble data sets for subsequent analysis and conclude suitable inferences from
  them.
- Use appropriate statistical software tools to analyse and interpret data.
