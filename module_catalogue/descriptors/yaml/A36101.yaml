aim: This module will introduce the student to the principles and practice of designing
  and implementing database systems. The student will gain competence in designing
  relational databases using Entity Relationship Modelling. They will implement relational
  databases using SQL data definition language. They will query the relational database
  using SQL data manipulation language. The students will be introduced to the concepts
  and use of NoSQL databases.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the Database design and
  implementation domain.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the Database design
  and implementation domain, particularly the use of ER diagrams for the design of
  relational databases and SQL DDL for the implementation of the relational database.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the Database design and implementation
  domain and ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge
  domains. To design and develop a suitable relational database system for a business
  scenario.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve basic business analytics problems by experimenting with
  the appropriate skills and tools. To design and develop a suitable relational database
  system for a business scenario to a level that includes an enhanced ER diagram and
  suitable queries appropriate to the business scenario.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse, design and implement
  solutions to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems
  through the use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

indicative content:
- Database Environment
- 'Database Analysis and Design: Relational Modelling, Normalisation, NoSQL databases,
  CAP theorem'
- 'Physical Database Design: Implementation descriptions of physical database'
- Database Implementation
learning and teaching methods:
- The lectures will introduce the theory content to the student. The student will
  be encouraged to participate in class discussions and ask questions to support their
  learning process.
- The practical classes facilitate the student in implementing the theory learned
  in the lectures using incremental steps to accomplish a skill.
- The continuous assessment will require the student to apply the theory and practical
  knowledge to a new business scenario.
- For online delivery, the lectures and practicals will be a combination of comprehensive
  rich media instructional content (notes), interactive synchronous video (live webinars/classes)
  and asynchronous interactive video playback (on-demand).

learning outcomes:
- Appraise the role of a database and its management system.
- Construct Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams from business scenarios and reproduce
  those diagrams into normalised relations ready for database implementation.
- Construct a physical database design.
- Create a relational database using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL).
- Construct queries on a relational database using SQL Data Manipulation Language
  (DML).
- Assess the suitability and use of NoSQL databases.
