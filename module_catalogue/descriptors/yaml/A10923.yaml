aim: Introduces the student to the fundamental building blocks of the visual aspect
  of the Web, with an emphasis on the basics of HTML, CSS and Java Script. These topics
  will be explored collectively to give the student the ability to design dynamic
  and responsive web micro-sites. Leverage this knowledge and apply it to Contact
  Management Systems (e.g. WordPress, Django) "mash-up" toolkits (e.g. Yahoo pipes,
  Zembly), to enable the construction of simple web applications and widgets (Facebook)
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Attention will be paid to the effective use of appropriate tools.'
- '40%-49%: Able to combine HTLM, CSS and simple Java script fragments in a simple
  micro-site.'
- 50%-59%:All of the above and in addition be able to implement a more sophisticated
  scripting capability.
- 60%-69%:Demonstrate an understanding of an encompassing platform, based around a
  simple CMS. Be able to introduce some simple new features into such a platform using
  the knowledge gained in the course. Attempt some simple mash-ups.
- 70%-100%:Be able to construct more ambitious mash-ups/widgets - incorporating HTML,
  CSS and JavaScript - with some aspect of server side processing.

learning and teaching methods:
- This course will be delivered via a combination of lecture and studio style practicals.
- 'The lectures will be ensuring the student has an appreciation of the essential
  formalisms: mark-up languages and simple scripting.'
- Photoshop or equivalent tools will be the focus of the initial programme. However,
  simple experiments in mash-up and widget development will involve exploration of
  representative environments and web based tools.
- Practicals will centre on putting these formalisms to work in the creation of micro
  sites.
- Attention will be paid to the effective use of appropriate tools.
