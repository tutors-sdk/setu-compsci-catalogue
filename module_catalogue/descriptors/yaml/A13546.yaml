aim: This module is concerned with the authoring of instructionally sound, accessible
  eLearning for different platforms. This can, for example, be a single part of a
  course, or all of a course whether it is in an academic environment, part of mandatory
  business training or a full distance learning course.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the eLearning.
- 40%-49%:Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the eLearning.
- 50%-59%:Ability to discuss key concepts of eLearning and ability to discover and
  integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve problems within eLearning by experimenting with the appropriate
  skills and tools.
- 70%-100%:All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
