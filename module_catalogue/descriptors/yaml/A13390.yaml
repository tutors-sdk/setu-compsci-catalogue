aim: The aim of this module is to examine the fundamental concepts underlying current
  developments in mobile communication systems and wireless computer networks. The
  module will cover current wireless systems and standards examining the technologies
  facilitating such networks. It provides students with the appreciation of the application,
  design and implementation of such networks.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to describe and compare the basic wireless technologies. Inability
  to describe wireless network components, issues involved in WLAN implementation
  and WLAN RF principles. Inability to configure basic WLAN settings and security.'
- '40%-49%: Able to describe and compare the main wireless technologies. Can provide
  description of main wireless network components and functions. Demonstrates the
