aim: This module will introduce the student to the principles and practice of designing
  distributed and object-oriented databases. The student will gain an understanding
  of multimedia database concepts, the architecture and design of a multimedia database.
  This module will also examine the procedures involved in the management and mining
  of multimedia databases.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of distributed, object-oriented
  and multimedia databases.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of distributed, object-oriented
  and multimedia databases.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the design, management and mining of
  multimedia databases and have the ability to discover and integrate related knowledge
  in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the design, management and mining of
  multimedia databases by experimenting with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
