aim: This module will introduce Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing concepts
  and techniques. Students will also critically analyse the theory and practice of
  implementing a Data Warehouse. This module will provide students with the knowledge
  to be able to successfully manage heterogeneous datasets and different options for
  integration, processing and storage. Students will investigate basic Business Intelligence
  tools and techniques, such as text mining,information retrieval and web content
  mining that would enable managers make better decisions and ultimately provide their
  organisation with a competitive advantage.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the design and development
  of a Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (BI) solutions.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the design and implementation

  and discover and integrate related knowledge in other disciplines like database
  and software development.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems in regards to Data Warehouse and BI design and
  development by experimenting with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate complex skills and tools.'
