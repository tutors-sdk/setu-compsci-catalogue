aim: This module extends the student?s knowledge of software engineering with a view
  to equipping them for their project work in this current year (year IV) of the programme.
  In addition it requires the student to prepare a consolidated report on the first
  stage of their fourth year project in conjunction with a learning contract established
  between student and supervisor.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Failure to demonstrate ability to understand, scope or document a problem.
  Level of problem chosen for project considered too trivial. Failure to meet the
  objectives of the learning contract appropriate to this stage of project.'
- '40%-49%: Demonstrates ability to understand scope and document problem. Generally
  meets objectives of learning contract. Ability to justify the choice of problem.
  Ability to present material in a clear manner.'
- '50%-59%: As above and ability to break down problem into appropriate packages.
  Comprehensive knowledge of area of problem. Ability to evaluate risks in mature
  and reflective manner. Planning is reasonable. Scoping shows an ability to abstract
  and get a clear overview of project.'
- '60%-69%: As above and ability to critique works in area of project. Document is
  of professional standard. Planning shows a degree of reflection and maturity.. Excellent
  presentation skills with demonstrable ability to explain complex problems in a clear
  manner.'
- '70%-100%: As above and produces an excellent document which clearly and precisely
  describes what needs to be done as part of the project. Demonstrates ability to
  abstract ideas and reflect on the process.'

indicative content:
- Consolidate knowledge of software development processes, particularly those that
  are based on an iterative strategy and early risk mitigation
- To enhance the student's ability to analyse a problem through scenarios that will
  subsequently provide a plan for construction and testing
- Where appropriate to define the user requirements of an intended system through
  use case descriptions
- Use of UML and other textual/diagramming techniques essential for discussing final
  year projects at a conceptual level
- To revise and consolidate the students' abilities to write referenced reports
- Using appropriate techniques, tentatively plan a project in detail breaking it into
  sub-tasks; rigorously identify deliverables and critical dependencies
learning and teaching methods:
- Weekly meetings with project supervisors.
- Self-directed learning using library and Internet sources.
- In the case of Product Development Mode, trying out carefully considered ideas to
  test if they are workable.

learning outcomes:
- Explain, in words and diagrammatically, to their peers, the work of their project.
- Interact with their supervisor in discussing how their project might proceed and
  the risks and interact options associated with their work.
- Complete a technological prototype of their project showing that all their hardware
  and software components work together.
- Prepare a test strategy for their project and have a detailed tentative plan for
  building a draft design.
