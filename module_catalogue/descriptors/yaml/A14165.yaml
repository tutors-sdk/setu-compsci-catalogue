aim: This module provides the students with an introduction to the practical processes
  for realizing and integrating pre-production assets within the production pipeline.
  It exposes the student to the concepts and themes of the creative process and the
  interdisciplinary nature of the workflow phases. The theories and processes underlying
  the creative process are examined, while emphasis is placed on the practical realization
  of concept assets through the production of a digital animatic.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and demonstrate key concepts of the production pipeline.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and demonstrate key concepts in the production pipeline.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to interpret key concepts of the production pipeline and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems using the production pipeline process skills
  by experimenting with the appropriate skills.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills.'
