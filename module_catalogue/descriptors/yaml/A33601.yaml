aim: This module introduces the student to some fundamental statistical concepts,
  to probability and sampling mechanisms as well as basic methods in descriptive and
  inferential statistics and regression.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Very limited knowledge and understanding of descriptive and inferential statistics
  and regression.'
- '40%-49%: Demonstrate a limited knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics
  and regression..'
- '50%-59%: Demonstrate satisfactory general knowledge of the main issues within descriptive
  and inferential statistics and regression.'
- '60%-69%: Demonstrate sound knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics
  and regression. Show ability to analyse and logically argue in an effective and
  mature style.'
- '70%-100%: Demonstrate authoritative handling of complex material and provide well
  focused analysis and convincing arguments on statistics and regression.'

indicative content:
- 'Introduction to statistics: types of variables (scale, nominal, ordinal); predictor
  versus response and observational versus experimental variables; descriptive and
  inferential statistics; population and sample; introduction to probability'
- 'Sampling: probability versus non-probability; simple random; stratified; cluster;
  systematic; convenience etc., randomising the run order of experiments.'
- 'Descriptive statistics: statistics measuring centre (mean, median, mode) and spread
  (standard deviation, quartiles); charts for categorical data (bar charts, pie charts)
  and scale data (histogram, stem and leaf plot, boxplot); analysis of outliers'
- 'Normal distribution: calculating probabilities and quartiles; verifying normality-probability
  plots; other distributions'
- 'Statistical Inference: null and alternative hypothesis; p-values; confidence intervals
  for means; t-tests; two sample paired and independent and ratio of variances; interpreting
  ANOVA table'
- 'Linear regression: parameter estimation using graphical and analytical methods;
  correlation coefficient; prediction; interpolation and extrapolation'
- 'Using a suitable software application such as Minitab or MS Excel: selecting appropriate
  methods correctly; interpreting output meaningfully'
learning and teaching methods:
- Lectures.
- In class exercises.
- Discussion.
- Self-directed learning is emphasized. Students are supported with notes, online
  material and feedback.
- Practicals using statistical software supports the learning experience.

learning outcomes:
- Describe and summarize the nomenclature and classifications of introductory statistics.
- Interpret appropriate descriptive statistics constructs and graphs to summarize
  variables of different types.
- Discuss methods of sampling.
- Compute using a calculator and tables, tests of statistical significance and interpret
  the analysis.
- Apply and appraise regression models.
- Determine the goodness of fit of the normal distribution model to sample data.
- Calculate elementary statistical analysis and interpret the output using industrial
  standard statistical software (e.g. Minitab).
