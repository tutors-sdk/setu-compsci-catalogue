aim: In this module, students explore and use the technologies required to exchange
  data between Electronic Control Units within the vehicle and with external systems
  outside of the vehicle, such as other vehicles, diagnostic tools, recharging stations
  and roadside infrastructure.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Inability to specify a coherent network design.
