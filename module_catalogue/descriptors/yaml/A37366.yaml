aim: The student is introduced to the use of analytics to support the decision making
  process in the business context. The student will experience the identification,
  description, cleaning, transforming and storage of structured data in an appropriate
  environment. Data mining techniques appropriate for the business analytics' context
  such as up-selling, cross-selling, customer classification and pattern discovery
  will be investigated. The student will conduct appropriate statistical analysis,
  rule generation and modelling in order to discover patterns and create new insights.
  The student will present and evaluate that analysis using visualisation tools.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the Business Analytics domain.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the Business Analytics
  knowledge domain, particularly the data mining process.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the Business Analytics knowledge domain
  and ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve basic business analytics problems by experimenting with
  the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
