aim: This module provides the essentials of computer forensics. Students will explore
  the area of digital forensics through file system forensics, network/online forensics
  and media forensics. Students will be introduced to the different stages of the
  forensic process, issues relating to digital evidence and will use a selection of
  forensic tools.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to effectively use relevant tools. Unable to differentiate stages
  of the forensic process.'
- '40%-49%: Can conduct basic computer forensic investigations.'
- '50%-59%: In addition to the above, can conduct computer forensic investigations
  using appropriate controls and recover deleted data.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, can interpret evidence extracted during a forensic investigation
  and corroborate it with other sources of evidence.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent level. Can evaluate the appropriateness
  of different forensic tools and approaches.'
