aim: International development agencies and NGOs are growing sectors with a traditionally
  low levels of IS knowledge, but in which demand for IS knowledge is increasing.
  This has created new career opportunities for IS professionals in agencies such
  as the United Nations, World Bank, NGOs and international banks asd well as in broader
  sectors dealing with mirgation, poverty, disaster response and recovery etc.. Information
  systems play a key role through the creation, for example, of effective, IT-enabled,
  inter-organisational networks and supply chains which reduce transaction costs,
  speed up response to trends and events, create productive and efficient access pathways
  to IT-mediated global marketplaces. Also, international agencies are implementing
  digitally-enabled systems to support rapid response and agency coordination in disaster
  recovery, conflict and other emergency situations. On the policy side, rich data
  is needed to understand development contexts and inform and evaluate policy and
  other interventions. This module explores how information systems, computer technologies,
  data analytics and knowledge-based systems play an important role in international
  and local development of marginalised communities and in responses to poverty, conflict,
  disaster and other development work.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Inability to demonstrate a rudimentary understanding of basic concepts associated
  with information systems in a development context or a rudimentary assessment of
  approaches, metrics, models and other aspect of the course materials. Inability
  to demonstrate the capacity to personally reflect on their learning and its implications
  for them as systems professionals or in a similar sphere.
- 40%-59%:Demonstrate some understanding of information systems in international development
  and related contexts. Understand and reflect upon the basic characteristics of the
  various theories and ideas presented in the course, and be able to practically apply
  these. Some reflective learning evident but may lack satisfactory critical ability.
- 60%-69%:The above to a very good level of competence. In addition, showing an ability
  to apply the approaches to complex problems and demonstrate a critical appreciation
  of the complex nature of international development. Be able to critically reflect
  on own learning experience to a relatively advanced level.
- 70%-100%:All the above to excellent level. Be able to critically assess the strengths
  and limitations of a particular technology and methods associated with IS in relation
  to development. Be able to assess trends in the field of information systems and
  international development. Demonstrate a deep level of reflection on the theories
  and ideas presented in this module and ability to weigh up vaiorus approaches to
  an advanced level.

  group-based workshop activities to explore these issues in real-life contexts.
- The course will also include debating of issues in relation to the role of information
  systems and digital technologies in the work of international agencies, NGOs and
  other actors.
