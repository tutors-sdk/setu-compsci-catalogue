aim: This module will build on the students basic Computer Networks knowledge. This
  module will provide a student with an understanding of Routing and Switching and
  other essential services in the operation and management of a networking infrastructure.
  The practical element will cover the configuration and management of these services.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe the basic functions and operation of dynamic routing protocols,
  static routes and switching technologies. Unable to configure basic networking infrastructure
  services.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to describe the basic functions and operation of dynamic routing
  protocols, static routes and switching technologies. Be able to configure basic
  networking infrastructure services.'
- '50%-59%: Be able to describe the main concepts in the management of a network infrastructure.
  Be able to design and apply best practice in the configuration and management of
