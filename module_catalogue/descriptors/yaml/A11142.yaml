aim: This module aims to help the learner understand the role of creativity, innovation,
  and problem solving in high technology industries. It will encourage the student
  to recognise the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that recognition to
  others. It will cover methods for generating new ideas and ways to increase creative
  and problem solving abilities through independent research, assessment and discussion.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to identify and apply basic concepts of the knowledge domain.'
- '40%-49%: Ability to identify and apply basic concepts of the knowledge domain.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to distinguish and apply key concepts clearly and interpret their
  relative importance in the knowledge domain.'
- '60%-69%: Ability to apply solutions to problems in a range of relevant contexts.
  An ability to employ a comprehensive range of specialised skills.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent level, with the ability to analyse and
  design solutions to a high standard for a range of complex or unseen problems.'
