aim: The objective of this module is to provide students with the understanding of
  techniques and methods used to model business systems to enable the development
  of reliable quality software. Students will analyse and design a system using various
  business and software analysis tools in order to gain an insight into how they can
  be utilised in the business modelling and software engineering process.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of Business Process Analysis
  and Software Engineering.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of software engineering.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to understand and apply the basics for BPM and Software Engineering
  Modelling'
- '60%-69%: Be able to select appropriate methodologies and apply the techniques of
  BPM and SE modelling to complete, real world systems'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex systems and unforeseen problems through
  the use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented using a combination of lectures and practical classes
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts.
- In practical classes, students will apply these concepts and engage with DevOps
  tools in order to gain experience in the software engineering process.
- For online delivery, the lectures and practical's will be a combination of comprehensive
  rich media instructional content (notes), interactive synchronous video (live webinars/classes)
  and asynchronous interactive video playback (on-demand).
