aim: This module will introduce the student to game-related project management skills.
  The student will build a game or game artifact based on multiple modules across
  the programme. This module will act as an opportunity for the student to contextualise
  and link cross-module concepts.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to develop a model and present a working artifact. Little evidence
  of project management and time management throughout project.'
- '40%-49%: Ability to develop a model and present a working artifact. Reasonable
  evidence of project management (e.g. Agile, Scrum) and time management throughout
  project.'
- '50%-59%: All the above and in addition has applied concepts from more than two
  modules/strands. Strong evidence of the different phases through the project and
  how the different techniques have benefited the project.'
- '60%-69%: All the above and in addition, be able to integrate and analyse concepts
  from more than two and at least one past module, showing an ability to transfer
  skills and knowledge across modules/strands. Shows evidence of strong project management
  and time management and of how the project has benefitted from both.'
- '70%-100%: All previous to an excellent level. Shows the ability to evaluate different
  models. Shows synthesis through the implementation of cross-strand innovative artifacts.'

indicative content:
- Manage a small to medium sized game project
- Design a small to medium sized game or game artifact
- Develop a small to medium sized game or game artifact
- Communication and presentation of ideas in correct, clear and modern format
learning and teaching methods:
- Lectures and practicals will be used to introduce new concepts and to consider the
  concepts' implications for module deliverables.
- Self-directed learning activities will require students to reflect upon the module
  materials, diagnose their learning needs and conduct research to satisfy these needs.
- Peer learning -- students will be encouraged to work in small collaborative groups
  to jointly consider and analyse in-class materials and to devise solutions to problems
  posed by the lecturer.
