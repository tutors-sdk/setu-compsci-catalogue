aim: The objective of this module is to equip students with the necessary skills to
  evaluate the security of systems and networks and implement appropriate solutions.
  Network security is covered at all layers of the TCP/IP protocol suite and system
  security is considered with respect to operating system, applications, virtualisation
  and cloud technologies.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe key network and system security technologies. Unable to
  effectively use relevant tools.'
- '40%-49%: Can describe in detail key security threats and technologies. Can carry
  out basic configuration of technologies to implement security policies for access
  control, encryption and authentication.'
- '50%-59%: All of the above and in addition can reason about the various approaches
  to security and their benefits and limitations.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, be capable of discussing the relative merits of securing
  at all layers or just at one layer. Also, can competently make use of security tools
  and technologies and carry out effective penetration tests.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent level. Be able to describe a variety
  of new developments in security. Demonstrate an understanding of some the trade-offs
  involved in providing security.'
