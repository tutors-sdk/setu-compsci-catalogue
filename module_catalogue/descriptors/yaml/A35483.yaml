aim: This module will build on statistical modelling techniques introduced in Data
  Analysis 1 and introduce the student to some machine learning techniques for data
  analysis. Statistical software such as Python or R will be used in the application
  of the techniques studied.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: The learner demonstrates little or no understanding of the fundamentals of
  the learning outcomes. Displays a lack of competence with regards to associated
  data analysis skills and statistics.'
- '40%-59%: The learner demonstrates limited understanding of the fundamentals of
  the learning outcomes. Displays some ability with regards to associated data analysis
  skills and statistics.'
- '60%-69%: As well as the above, the learner demonstrates reasonable understanding
  of the fundamentals of the learning outcomes. Displays reasonable competence with
  regards to associated data analysis skills and statistics.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to excellent levels. In addition, the learner demonstrates
  comprehensive knowledge and understanding of all learning outcomes. Displays advanced
  competence and independence with regards to associated data analysis skills and
  statistics.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module is focused on using appropriate techniques for time series analysis
  and dimensionality reduction and subsequent visualisation and reporting. As a result
  the emphasis is on practice with real data, with its inherent issues such as missing
  values, outliers, etc. Building on the Data Analysis 1 module, students will learn
  how to model and analyse real data.

learning outcomes:
- Evaluate time series models and utilise statistical software to fit and apply models
  to data.
- Explore dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and LDA and implement them
  with real world datasets.
- Utilise machine learning methodologies to facilitate pre-processing, dimensionality
  reduction and model selection.
- Analyse, interpret and report findings using appropriate presentation skills.
