aim: This module will provide the students with the necessary skill set to develop
  a 3D game using the Unity Game Engine. It focuses on a high-level approach and the
  use of 3D game engines to create video games that implement some of the basic features
  found in commercial video games (e.g., collision detection, 3D navigation, 3D views,
  and basic artificial intelligence).
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to understand, explain the workings of or modify, a simple program.
  Inability to write simple programs using constructs as per learning outcome (3).
  Inability to use the programming environment to edit, run and debug programs.'
- '40%-49%: Able to understand, explain the workings of or modify a simple program.
  Able to write simple programs using constructs and data structures as per learning
  outcome (3). Able to use the programming environment to edit, run and debug programs
  comfortably. Can produce a prototype of a simple system.'
- '50%-59%: All the above and in addition correctly choose appropriate programming
  and data structures. Use pre-defined class libraries in programs (e.g. String).
  Show a high level of competency with programming environment.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, able to apply given solutions to new, similar problems. Starts
  to reference on-line documentation to examine new constructs, libraries. Starts
  to see programs in terms of system of components.'
- '70%-100%: All previous to an excellent level. Starts to understand the concept
  of good solutions.'

indicative content:
- Collision detection
- Navigation
- Environment creation
- Javascript coding
- Object instantiation
- Artificial intelligence
- Rigid bodies
- Assets creation and management
- 3D animation
- User interface
learning and teaching methods:
- Since this module is focused on developing practical programming skills (i.e., game
  programming for mobile devices), the four contact hours will be delivered in the
  computer labs in the form of two 2-hour practicals.
- Due to the very practical nature of the skills to be acquired in this module, these
  practical sessions will be centred around the idea of learning by doing, whereby
  students develop proficiency in the specified skill set through guided activities,
  and whereby lecturers provide short formal presentations of relevant concepts and
  technologies, as well as practical tips, feedback, and best practices.

learning outcomes:
- Code a 3-Dimensional game with the Unity engine with a corresponding GUI.
- Code game mechanics using Javascript.
- Employ both bespoke assets (audio, textures, 3D objects), and built-in assets (audio,
  textures, 3D objects), to create indoors and outdoors environments.
- Code and use navigation (first- and third-person controllers), collision detection,
  and cameras (e.g., view ports, multiple cameras, layers, etc.).
- Use rigid-bodies, particles effects, and manage 3D animations for improved realism.
- Employ and manage NPCs (e.g, AI, Finite-State Machines and navigation).
