aim: 'The Masters program culminates in the dissertation, an extended project that
  allows the student to engage in independent research, applying and developing the
  content of the taught modules to a topic of their choice which aligns with the research
  activities of the department. The Dissertation is an individual piece of work and
  will also be supported by the Research Methods and Dissertation module. It is further
  supported by research seminars hosted in the Department of Computing and Mathematics
  as part of the academic life of the School and which deal with particular aspects
  of postgraduate research in computing. The primary emphasis here bis on independent
  study. The dissertation is begins in Semester 1, proceeds through semester 2 (during
  these semesters the student is placed under the guidance of a supervisor) and is
  then fully engaged in what is effectively a third semester without formal supervision.
  This module is closely related to the ``Research Methods & Dissertation Proposal''''
  module and its outcomes represent the second phase of work towards the dissertation.
  The aims of this module are to: 1. Enable students to specialize in a relevant and
  suitable topic of their choice and according of their particular interests and related
  to the course they are taking. The research will align with the research programme
  of the Department of Computing and Mathematics. 2.Provide the opportunity for students
  to engage in supervised, but independently undertaken research, study and learning.
  3.Allow students to obtain and demonstrate proficiency in the advanced research
  skills and analytical techniques that they have acquired on the course. 4.Enable
  students to apply their own learning self-critically in the conduct of a major research
  project. 5.Offer the opportunity for students to actively engage with the academic
  research community in the Department of Computing and Mathematics.'
assessment criteria:
- <40%:The student has demonstrated a poor grasp of the fundamentals of the chosen
  research area and has either failed to complete the thesis or the thesis is so rudimentary
  as to provide little evidence of capacity to conduct independent research in their
  chosen topic.
- 40%-59%:The student has met the criteria for a pass, and demonstrates a grasp of
  the fundamentals of the chosen research area.
- 60%-69%:The student has shown a high level of independence in the conduct of the
  research and technical competence in practical work undertaken. A strong performance
  achieved in all components of assessment but the creativity, resourcefulness, depth
  of knowledge, critical and analytical ability or flexibility of thought required
  for a distinction is lacking. In some cases higher quality work may be marginally
  publishable.
- 70%-100%:The dissertation comprises a non-trivial piece of research which has been
  superbly executed and whose results and originality are worthy of dissemination
  in the academic community (publishable). If software has been produced, its design,
  implementation and deployment are exemplary and key aspects likely to be publishable
  as an academic paper. Student has demonstrated outstanding analytical skills and
  deemed very suitable for a research career.

indicative content:
- The curriculum content is in essence the particular subject of the dissertation
  - this is a three semester module and supervision arrangements are 1 hour per week/student
  until the start of the "third semester" and this is a total of 24 hours for this
  module and this figure is included in the relevant entry under "Learning Modes"
  below
- The Dissertation should contain clear objectives, motivation and concise, well-formed
  research questions relating to this subject, and demonstrate that stated objectives
  of the research have been achieved
- At the end of the process the student should communicate the results of their research
  in writing by producing an academic dissertation of their research area
- An oral presentation, and interview if necessary, will also be required
- Dissertation structure and related documents are available in the Department for
  ``taught Masters'' Dissertations
learning and teaching methods:
- This module involves self-directed and self-paced research effort under the guidance
  of an assigned supervisor.
