aim: This module looks at the lighting and rendering components of the 3D digital
  animation pipeline. The module will encompass materials editing, lighting and shadows,
  and rendering using an industry-standard rendering engine. Students will have the
  opportunity to explore advanced techniques and effects that may be used to light
  and render complex 3D scenes and, using pre-existing scene assets, and to produce
  a photo-realistic and production-quality rendered scene.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domain(s).'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domain(s).'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge domain and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
