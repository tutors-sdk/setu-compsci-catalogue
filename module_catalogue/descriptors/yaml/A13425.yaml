aim: The fundamental area of Business Intelligence (BI) is the skill to effectively
  communicate analysis, supporting a firm?s decision makers. The aim of this module
  is how BI visualises and analyses a firm's data. It builds on the skills learnt
  in a previous module from the creation of insights from structured and unstructured
  data. Visualization will facilitate the understanding of data and publish required
  metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to a business. The approach
  of this module will enable visualisation for accessing, analysing, managing and
  interacting with data.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of BI Visualisation.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of BI Visualisation.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of BI Visualisation and the ability to
  discover and integrate related knowledge in other data and information system modules.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within BI Visualisation by experimenting with
  the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
