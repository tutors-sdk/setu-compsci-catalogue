aim: This module introduces students to the basic concepts in matrices, linear and
  non linear functions, sequences and series and logic. Practical labs will act as
  a support as students will perform relevant calculations and construct relevant
  graphs.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key mathematical concepts.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key mathematical concepts.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key mathematical concepts and ability to discover and
  integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve mathematical problems using appropriate skills and software
  tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate mathematical skills and tools.'
