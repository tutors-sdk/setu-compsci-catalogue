aim: This module will introduce the student to fundamental distributed version control
  systems and basic communication skills, including presentation skills. The student
  will practice these skills through building an artifact based on multiple concurrent
  strands/modules. This module will act as an opportunity for the student to contextualise
  and link cross-strand concepts.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to develop a model and present a working artifact. No digital portfolio
  presented.'
- 40%-49%:Ability to develop a model and present a working artifact. Digital portfolio
  presented (including version control).
- 50%-59%:All the above and in addition has applied concepts from more than two modules/strands.
  Well-structured digital portfolio.
- 60%-69%:All the above and in addition, be able to integrate and analyse concepts
  from more than two and at least one past module, showing an ability to transfer
  skills and knowledge across modules/strands.
- '70%-100%: All previous to an excellent level. Shows the ability to evaluate different
  models. Shows synthesis through the implementation of cross-strand innovative artifacts.
  Innovative use of distributed version control system.'
