aim: This module will expose the learner to statistical and other methods that will
  enable them to create a variety of visualisations from different types of data,
  using both traditional and contemporary methods. Issues pertaining to the collection
  of data will be presented as will cautions on the potential for statistics to mislead.
  A basic introduction to the statistical tools used in data analytics is also given.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to apply data visualisation methods at a basic level.'
- '40%-49%: Able to apply basic data visualisation methods.'
- '50%-59%: Able to apply a range of data visualisation methods.'
- '60%-69%: As above. And demonstrate a reasonable comprehension of the potential
  and limitations of data visualisation.'
- '70%-100%: As above. And demonstrate am excellent comprehension of the potential
  and limitations of data visualisation.'

full title: Data Visualisation
indicative content:
- 'Data: Sourcing; Primary and secondary data; Sampling mechanisms; Validity checks
  -- outlier detection, data cleaning etc; Big data'
- 'Traditional approaches: Review of conventional statistical charts -- elementary
  (histograms, boxplots, pareto, pie charts etc.); Advanced (multiple, clustered,
  stacked, contour etc.); Selecting suitable charts for a given purpose'
- 'Lies and statistics: Misrepresentation and deception in statistics in general and
  in statistical charts in particular; Historical case studies'
- 'Contemporary visualisation charts: Static (linear, planar, multidimensional, temporal,
  tree/hierarchical etc.) and dynamic'
- 'Software: Statistical visualisation and graphics tools -- using both industry standard
  software (e.g SAS visual analytics etc.) and non-commercial software (e.g. GGobi,
  R etc.)'
- 'Statistical methods: Overview of methods used in data analytics using appropriate
  software. (E.g. significance testing, multiple regression, cluster analysis etc.)'
learning and teaching methods:
- Lectures will be used to present the principles and the constructs of data visualisation
  as well as to demonstrate industry standard application. The importance of practice
  will be emphasised with a philosophy of learning by doing being fostered in the
  laboratory sessions.

learning outcomes:
- Discuss the issues pertaining to the collection and preparation of data.
- Choose an appropriate, traditional, statistical chart that will successfully convey
  information contained in a data set.
- Determine in statistical metrics or charts, potential to accidentally or deliberate
  misrepresent information in a data set.
- Select and utilize suitable software that creates data visualisations -- both traditional
  (elementary and advanced) and contemporary (static and dynamic).
- Select and utilize suitable software that implements statistical methods used in
  data analytics.
