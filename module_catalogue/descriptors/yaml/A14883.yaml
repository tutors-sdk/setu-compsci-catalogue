aim: This module gives the student experience in completing their research-based work.
  This module continues the work completed in semester 1, with a focus on data gathering
  and analysis, all of which will culminate in the student deriving answers to their
  research questions. These answers should make a solid contribution to the body of
  knowledge in their chosen research area.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Failure to incorporate feedback. Failure to competently demonstrate understanding
  of research.'
- '40%-49%: Produces basic set of findings. Produces complete set of documentation.
  Able to demonstrate own work in competent manner.'
- '50%-59%: As above and produces a solid set of robust findings. Documentation and
  reports are clear and of good quality. Comprehensive knowledge of methdologies and
  techniques.'
- '60%-69%: As above and findings make a contribution to research area. Demonstrates
  ability to solve unfamiliar research problems. Shows good judgement in technology
  selection. Documentation shows evidence of ability to see limitations or potential
  in approaches used.'
- '70%-100%: As above and produces an excellent piece of research with equally excellent
  documentation. Demonstrates ability to abstract ideas and reflect on the research
  process.'

indicative content:
- Incorporate feedback from project supervisors/examiners, relating to the work done
  in Semester 1, that work being a literature review and consequent formulation of
  a research question, and initial investigative work on appropriate research methodologies,
  including data gathering strategies
- Complete the consideration of the research methodologies to be used, and design
  of the data collection instruments
- Further develop the student's ability to write referenced academic and technical
  reports, principally a required final dissertation, not less than 4000 words and
  not more than 6000 words, accompanied by a poster and a video
- To provide the student with the opportunity (and requirement) to meet with a supervisor
  week by week and to complete the work according to the initial or a revised plan
- To enable the student to apply investigative, problem-solving and technical knowledge
  to address issues as they arise
learning and teaching methods:
- Weekly meetings with project supervisors.
- Self-directed learning using library and Internet sources.
- Validation of chosen methdology, techniques and findings.
