aim: This module introduces students to the different aspects of digital imaging including
  capturing and editing digital images using industry standard equipment and software.
  Students explore the creative and technical aspects of photography, editing, manipulation
  and compression of digital images for multimedia and web solutions.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of digital imaging.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of digital imaging theory
  and technology.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of digital imaging and ability to integrate
  related knowledge into similar knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Ability to solve problems within creative digital imaging by experimenting
  with appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level with the ability to analyse and design
  solutions to a high standard for a range of complex or unseen problems.'
