aim: The aim of the module is to provide students with an understanding of the main
  concepts and issues in the design and development of mobile games. Students are
  given the opportunity to acquire practical experience of the tools, technologies
  and platforms employed in the development of mobile games.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to demonstrate an understanding of the issues attendant to mobile
  game development, as per Learning Outcome 1. Inability to implement simple games
  on a mobile device using the development tools and methodology covered during the
  module as per Learning Outcomes 2,3 & 4.'
- '40%-49%: Able to demonstrate a basic understanding of mobile game development features
  and issues, as per Learning Outcome 1. Able to implement simple games on a mobile
  device as per Learning Outcomes 2 & 3.'
- '50%-59%: All the above and in addition able to evaluate own code for significant
  performance and resource bottlenecks, as per Learning Outcome 4.'
- '60%-69%: All of the above, in addition implement all required features consistently
  well.'
- '70%-100%: All previous to an excellent level. Implement additional features or
  uses technology/tools-chains not directly presented in class.'

indicative content:
- 'Overview of mobile gaming devices: mobile gaming platforms and development environments,
  cross platforms game engines and native game development'
- 'Developing mobiles games: UI considerations, asset management and rendering for
  mobile devices, implementing gameplay mechanics, deploying games on mobile devices'
- 'Mobile gaming markets: mobile game market analysis, revenue generation and publishing
  games'
learning and teaching methods:
- Since this module is focused on developing practical programming skills (i.e., game
  programming for mobile devices), the four contact hours will be delivered in the
  computer labs in the form of two 2-hour practicals.
- Due to the very practical nature of the skills to be acquired in this module, these
  practical sessions will be centred around the idea of learning by doing, whereby
  students develop proficiency in the specified skill set through guided activities,
  and whereby lecturers provide short formal presentations of relevant concepts and
  technologies, as well as practical tips, feedback, and best practices.
- Practical exercises will provide students with an opportunity to develop a range
  of technical competencies relating to mobile game development using industry standard
  development tools, technologies and techniques. Emphasis is placed on further developing
  the students' software engineering and development skills.
