aim: This module introduces Computer Networking terminology and concepts, and examines
  various network protocols and models. Students will use protocol analysis software
  to explore various network protocol operations. TCP/IP and IP addressing are presented
  as well as an exploration of real-time Multimedia applications and protocols. Quality
  of Service (QoS) is also discussed and a brief examination of resource management
  is also provided. Practical skills are an essential part of this module.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe the major functions and operation of a Computer Network.
  Unable to describe and compare the OSI and TCP/IP models. Poor understanding of
  role of communications protocols in computer networks.'
- '40%-49%: Can describe and compare the OSI and TCP/IP models. Can provide overview
  of main computer network components and protocols.'
- '50%-59%: All of the above. Can describe in detail the data encapsulation process.
  Demonstrate an understanding of basic LAN implementation.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, be able to recommend a network solution given an organisations''
  requirements.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
