aim: This module introduces students to the capabilities of cloud computing. Basic
  concepts of cloud computing are covered and students carry out a series of practical
  exercises with cloud computing technologies and services.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to explain key cloud computing concepts, technologies and services.
  Unable to effectively use a cloud platform.'
- '40%-49%: Able to explain key cloud computing concepts, technologies and services
  and carry out basic analysis. Can deploy an application to a popular cloud platform.'
- '50%-59%: In addition, can explain in substantial technical detail key cloud computing
  technologies and services. Can deploy a moderately sophisticated application to
  a popular cloud platform.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, can deploy a complex application to a popular cloud platform.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent level. Can go beyond the basic practical
  specification and demonstrate competence with other services.'
