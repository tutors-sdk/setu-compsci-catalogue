aim: This module will introduce the student to the concepts and practice of relational
  database modelling. The student will gain competence in Conceptual Data Modelling
  and Logical Data Modelling. The student will also examine the redundancy that can
  arise in poorly modelled systems and apply Normalisation to eliminate the redundancy.
  They will gain experience in the design and implementation of a practical database
  system.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of Relational Database Design.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of Relational Database
  Design.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of Relational Database Design and the
  ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the field Relational Database Design
  by experimenting with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures, and/or tutorials, and
  computer-based practicals.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts. The
  student will be encouraged to manage their own learning by asking questions as well
  as being presented with problems similar to those presented in lectures.
- The practical element is fundamental. The aim is to provide the student with the
  skills and confidence to apply what has been demonstrated and learned.

learning outcomes:
- Analyse database terminologies, database structures and components.
- Appraise the elements of the Relational Model.
- Model and construct Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams for business scenarios.
- Transform an ER diagram into a set of relations, which are ready for database implementation.
- Transform unnormalised relations into a set of normalised relations through the
  rules of normalisation which adhere to relational data model principles.
- Construct Data Manipulation and Data Definition statements.
