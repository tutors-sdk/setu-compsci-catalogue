aim: The module applies matrix algebra to 2D and 3D transformations - including translations,
  scaling, shearing, rotation and perspective. It also introduces the student to descriptive
  statistics with an emphasis on visually presenting data in an appropriate and informative
  way using traditional statistical constructs. The practical element of this module
  applies matrix and vector algebra to computer graphics and also, obtains visual
  representations of data using software.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to perform basic mathematical calculations in matrix and vector algebra
  and statistics.'
- '40%-49%: Able to perform some mathematical calculations and practical implementation
  in matrix and vector algebra and statistics.'
- '50%-59%: Able to perform a range of mathematical calculations and practical implementation
  in matrix and vector algebra and statistics.'
- '60%-69%: As above. And demonstrate a basic competence with some of the advanced
  techniques in matrix and vector algebra and statistics.'
- '70%-100%: As above. And demonstrate excellence competence with the advanced techniques
  in matrix and vector algebra and statistics.'

indicative content:
- 'Matrix algebra: Multiplication; Transformations - translations, scaling, shearing,
  rotation and perspective'
- 'Reference frames: Cartesian and homogeneous coordinates; Right handed and left
  handed 3D reference frames'
- '2D and 3D geometric entities: Polygons and polyhedrons'
- 'Vector algebra: Dot product; Cross product; Hidden face problem; Illumination problem'
- 'Introduction to statistics: Types of variables (scale, nominal, ordinal); Descriptive
  and inferential statistics; Population and sample; Probability and non-probability
  sampling'
- 'Descriptive statistics: Statistics measuring centre (mean, median, mode) and spread
  (standard deviation, quantiles); Charts for categorical and scale data -- basic
  (histograms, pie charts etc.) and advanced (clustered/stacked charts etc.)'
learning and teaching methods:
- The mathematical constructs underpinning computer graphics are presented in lectures
  and reinforced in tutorials. The algorithms are then implemented in weekly practical
  sessions. The statistical material is similarly presented with the theory in the
  class room and the practice in the labs with appropriate statistical software.
