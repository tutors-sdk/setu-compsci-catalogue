aim: This module aims to provide students with the skills to uncover information that
  is found in online environments. Such environments may include cloud environments,
  electronic mail messages, web pages, web servers, web browsers and messaging applications.
  It also introduces the area of Open Source Intelligence. The module has a significant
  practical component where the student will use various analysis tools and techniques
  to explore the areas listed above.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge domain.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the specific knowledge
  domain(s). Gather basic evidence types. Reconstruct basic events.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of the specific knowledge domain and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains. Ability
  to reconstruct online based evidence and interpret it.'
- 60%-69%:Be able to solve problems within the specific knowledge domain(s) by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools. Be able to attempt alternative methods or
  tools for the extraction and interpretation of information from gathered data.
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
