aim: This module introduces students to problem solving techniques using algebraic,
  linear programming, calculus and graph theory methods. Students will experience
  an applied element to the module which will involve creating pseudocode for the
  implementation of appropriate problem solving methods.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key mathematical problem solving concepts.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key mathematical problem solving concepts.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key mathematical concepts and ability to discover and
  integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems by experimenting with appropriate mathematical
  problem solving techniques.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
