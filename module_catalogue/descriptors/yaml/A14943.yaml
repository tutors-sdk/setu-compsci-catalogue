aim: Introduce the notations, programming languages, tools and techniques for the
  design, implementation and deployment of mobile, progressive web apps. Assuming
  a foundation-level understanding of HTML, CSS and web development, the module will
  explore the challenges associated with creating applications for mobile devices.
  In particular, the module will focus on HTML5 based approaches, with an emphasis
  on JavaScript/HTML/CSS avenues, coupled with JavaScript based approaches to server
  side/cloud based infrastructure.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Inability to apply a suitable framework to develop a mobile web application.
- '40%-59%: Be able to demonstrate compatancy in the tool suite and the ability to
  develop and deploy small-scale solutions.'
- '60%-69%: In addition to above, implements solutions to medium-sized problems that
  demonstrate a good understanding of the main patterns and practices of mobile web
  app design.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent standard, and incorporates self-directed
  investigation into state-of-the-art mobile web technology.'
