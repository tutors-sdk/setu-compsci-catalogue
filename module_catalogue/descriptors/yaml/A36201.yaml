aim: This module provides the essentials of data security. Topics covered include
  relevant security threats and vulnerabilities and the services available to address
  these threats. Cryptographic foundations that underpin many security mechanisms
  are covered. Network security is covered in the context of ensuring secure access
  to data in motion. Security-enabled frameworks like Distributed Ledger Technology
  (also known as blockchain) and privacy preserving techniques are highlighted.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe key data security technologies. Unable to distinguish
  between different types of data security threat or to present instances of them
  in a clear manner. Unable to effectively use relevant tools.'
- '40%-49%: Can describe in detail key security threats and technologies. Can carry
  out basic configuration of technologies to implement security policies and to store
  data in a distributed manner. Able to present instances of data security weaknesses
  and to assess the privacy implications of a basic system.'
- '50%-59%: In addition to the above, can reason about the various approaches to security
  and their benefits and limitations. Able to explain in context and present instances
  of privacy threats and how they might be realised. Able to model data in a software
  system with multiple usage scenarios and security requirements, including those
  drawn from the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) triad.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, can explain basis of a variety of cryptographic schemes.
  Can competently make use of security and privacy procedures, tools and technologies
  in the context of the intended use of data. Able to present and explain why data
  privacy in analytical settings is difficult to achieve.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to an excellent level. Can demonstrate an understanding
  of some the trade-offs involved in providing security, trust and privacy. Able to
  demonstrate in detail how to protect data, its subjects and its users.'
