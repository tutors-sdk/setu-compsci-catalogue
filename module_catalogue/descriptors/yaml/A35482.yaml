aim: This module will introduce the student to statistical techniques in data analysis,
  with a particular focus on linear models. Statistical software (such as Python or
  R) will be used in the application of techniques studied.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: The learner demonstrates little or no understanding of the fundamentals of
  the learning outcomes. Displays a lack of competence with regards to associated
  data analysis skills and statistics.'
- '40%-59%: The learner demonstrates limited understanding of the fundamentals of
  the learning outcomes. Displays some ability with regards to associated data analysis
  skills and statistics.'
- '60%-69%: As well as the above, the learner demonstrates reasonable understanding
  of the fundamentals of the learning outcomes. Displays reasonable competence with
  regards to associated data analysis skills and statistics.'
- '70%-100%: All of the above to excellent levels. In addition, the learner demonstrates
  comprehensive knowledge and understanding of all learning outcomes. Displays advanced
  competence and independence with regards to associated data analysis skills and
  statistics.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module is focused on data analysis and developing good practices in dealing
  with data -- in all stages, from efficient data storage, using appropriate techniques
  for EDA and subsequent visualisation and reporting. As a result the emphasis is
  on practice with real data, with its inherent issues such as missing values, outliers,
  etc. Building on the Introduction to Applied Statistics module, students will learn
  how to model and analyse real data.

learning outcomes:
- Utilise standard statistical software to perform typical exploratory data analysis,
  data wrangling, analysis and reporting.
- Utilise the concepts of multiple regression to estimate regression models using
  appropriate software.
- Utilise the concepts of a generalized linear model (GLM) to apply them to real data
  using appropriate software.
- Establish and apply corrections to problems when applying generalized linear models
  to real data.
