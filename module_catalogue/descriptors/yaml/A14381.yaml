aim: This module addresses the role of information and information systems in support
  of supply chain management. The module explores the concepts of supply chains and
  networks, and its foundation disciplines. The module examines frameworks that support
  supply chain strategy, supply chain integration, and supply chain processes. The
  role of information in supporting the operation and management of supply chains
  is examined. The use of information systems to support supply chain operations and
  management through planning, control, and execution is investigated. The use of
  modern analytics and business intelligence approaches and tools within supply chains
  is explored. Approaches for the design of supply chain information systems architectures
  are also studied.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of supply chain integration
  technologies.'
- '40%-59%: Be able to describe and discuss key concepts of supply chain integration
  technologies and ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge
  domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the supply chain integration technologies
  domains by experimenting with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and computer based practicals.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts. Lectures
  will be supplemented by participative case studies and independent reading on the
  issues covered in the lecture material.
- The practical element is intended to provide the student with the skills needed
  to use and understand technologies available to assist in supply chain planning,
  control, and execution, and in supply chain analytics.
