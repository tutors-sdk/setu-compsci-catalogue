aim: This module concentrates on the physical design and implementation of a database.
  Database Management concepts are also examined such as Transaction Management, Concurrency
  Control and Recovery. Students will be provided with the knowledge and skills to
  administer and manage a commercial database.

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures, and/or tutorials, and
  computer-based practicals.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts. The
  student will be encouraged to manage their own learning by asking questions as well
  as being presented with problems similar to those presented in lectures.
- The practical element is fundamental. The aim is to provide the student with the
  skills and confidence to apply what has been demonstrated and learned.
