aim: This module builds on concepts introduced in Embedded Systems Architecture &
  Hardware module. It covers the programming of high performance embedded processor
  systems using C and assembly language. Software development tools are extensively
  used with the main emphasis being on application development, testing, debugging
  and verification.
