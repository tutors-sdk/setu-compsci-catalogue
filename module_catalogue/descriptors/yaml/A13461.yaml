aim: This module serves as an introduction to 3D modelling and comprises an emphasis
  on the modelling pipeline, from concept to model creation. Students will acquire
  a knowledge of the craft of 3D modelling and will gain experience in producing a
  number of 3D models using a number of essential tools within an industry-led 3D-creation
  toolset.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to identify and navigate the main components of a 3D production
  software platform. Inability to critically evaluate techniques used in the creation
  and exporting of 3D computer graphics models.'
- '40%-49%: Ability to identify and navigate the main components of a 3D production
  software platform. Ability to describe key concepts of the 3D modelling pipeline.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss and critically evaluate key concepts of the 3D modelling
  pipeline and techniques.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the framework of the 3D modelling pipeline
  by experimenting with appropriate skills and tools of the 3D production software.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of problems through the use and modification of appropriate
  skills and tools of the 3D production software.'
