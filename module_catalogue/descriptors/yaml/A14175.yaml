aim: In this module students are introduced to the theoretical perspectives underpinning
  fraudulent behaviour in a business context. The module identifies the role of the
  forensic accountant/fraud auditor and examines an array of fraud deterrence and
  detection techniques with particular emphasis on financial statement fraud. This
  module focuses on providing a general view of accounting and audit principles, focusing
  on financial investigation and internal control. Through case studies, common risks
  that increase the possibility of fraudulent behaviour and associated red flags are
  examined.

- '40%-49%: Limited consideration, discussion and reflection of main points and concepts
  addressed.'
- '50%-59%: Consideration and limited analysis of main points and concepts. Limited
  discussion and reflection, but showing a clear grasp of the underlying principles.
  Some evidence of theory to practical integration.'
- '60%-69%: Address and analyse the main points and show clear evidence of a good
  grasp of the underlying knowledge.'
- '70%-100%: Demonstrates good structure and clarity of thought. Good level of critical
  analysis, originality of thought and comprehensive knowledge base. Good critical
  evaluation and synthesis of relevant issues, showing an ability to integrate theory
  to practice.'
