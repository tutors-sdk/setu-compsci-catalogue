aim: Having examined the software development process in detail, the student is now
  introduced to a more formal way to treat systems. Using mathematics, the student
  learns how to precisely specify computer systems. This exposes the student to rigorous
  and critical thinking skills. This module will also help the student to prioritise
  needs in a system, e.g. correctness, usability so that appropriate methodologies
  are chosen. An overview of the formal life-cycle is presented.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to understand the basics of mathematical concepts or notation.
  Inability to write simple specifications of parts of a system, e.g. simple operations.'
- '40%-49%: Able to write simple (familiar) formal specifications. Able to write simple,
  robust operations. Understands the role of formal methods in software development.'
- '50%-59%: In addition, show the ability to choose appropriate data models and types.
  Able to write complete specifications for simple systems.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, be able to write complete specificationsl for limited systems
  with increased complexity. Able to scope an unfamiliar system.'
- '70%-100%: All previous to an excellent level. Able to reflect on the structure
  of a consistent specification and write a clearer, more elegant specification with
  the same functionality.'

full title: Formal Specification
indicative content:
- Introduction to Formal Methods
- Mathematics of Formal Specification
- Formal Specification notation (e.g. Z, B)
- Modelling using notation, writing system states and operations using chosen notation
learning and teaching methods:
- As this module requires a strong mathematical foundation, it is important that the
  student be presented with these foundations in a lecture context and that these
  concepts practiced on specification examples in tutorials.
- Lectures and tutorials will be interleaved, with small examples regularly being
  attempted in class.
- When the student has learned the necessary component skills, s/he will practice
  these skills on part of a substantial project.
- This will enliven his/her understanding of the notation as well as demonstrating
  to him/her the advantages of rigour in software development.

learning outcomes:
- Choose when formal methods are applicable in software development.
- Read and write formal specifications and explain them clearly using informal means.
- Choose the mathematical model underlying the formal specification language in this
  context.
- Write consistent specifications and be able to explain why they are consistent.
- Assess a complex system, distill an inderstanding of it into an abstracted view,
  and model this view using approproate abstract data models and mathematical description.
- Formally specify part of a real world system (e.g. substantial student project)
  with appropriate narrative text.
