aim: The rate of ICT development has outpaced society?s ability to regulate responsible
  usage of such technologies. Technology has a profound effect on many aspects of
  work, living systems, the environment and society in general. The computing professional
  has unique responsibilities as the creator, developer, implementer and manager of
  these systems. This module will provide students with a critical awareness of ethical
  issues in modern society in relation to computing technologies and the systems they
  impact. It offers an introduction to the controversies, questions and strategies
  for ethical computing. It also inculcates an awareness of the key ways in which
  computing professionals can act ethically, including the role of important standards
  and professional communities.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Unable to demonstrate rudimentary understanding of the concepts and issues
  described in the indicative content. Failing to demonstrate satisfactory ability
  to formulate solutions for ethical dilemmas in computing.
- 40%-49%:Able to demonstrate a rudimentary understanding of the basic concepts and
  issues outlined in the module indicative content. Being able to formulate basic
  solutions for typical ethical dilemmas taking into account a narrow range of factors.
  Little demonstrable reflective learning present.
- 50%-59%:Able to demonstrate a solid understanding of the concepts and issues outlined
  in the indicative content taking into account a range of factors, and demonstrate
  some critical, reflective awareness of ethical issues in computing.
- 60%-69%:Able to demonstrate a very good understanding of the major concepts and
  issues outlined in the indicative content taking into account a wide range of factors,
  and demonstrate some critical awareness of the complexity of ethical issues in computing.
  Able to reflect upon the role of of ethical issues in the working life of a computing
  professional and how these might impact others. Appreciate the ways computing professionals
  can obtain peer support.
- 70%-100%:All the previous to an excellent level including capacity to solve ethical
  problems and creatively engage in ethical discourse and the identification of appropriate
  potential solutions.
