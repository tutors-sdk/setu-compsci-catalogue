aim: This laboratory-based module provides a comprehensive study of model-based design
  and development for dynamic, embedded control systems. Industry-standard interactive
  model-based development tools are used to model, simulate, implement, and test a
  variety of time-varying systems. A number of case studies related to intelligent
  automotive control are examined.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to define an abstract model for a specified system. Unable to use
  modelling tools.'
- '40%-49%: Define, model and simulate basic embedded solution. The work carried out
  required a high level of supervision.'
- '50%-59%: In addition to above, analyse specialised systems. Interpret simulation
  test results and update model accordingly. Present results adequately.'
- '60%-69%: In addition to above, has a high level of experimental skills and has
  shown the ability to produce clear and logical analysis of assessment work.'
- '70%-100%: All the previous to an excellent level. Can critically assess any experimental
  work undertaken. Combine self-directed research of state-of-the-art model-based
  design systems in assessment work.'
