aim: This module aims to provide the student with an understanding of an architectural
  approach to development of information systems. The module introduces the constituent
  parts of architecture and their interrelationship. The student is introduced to
  the use of architectural frameworks and to the use of architecture approaches for
  different contexts within the organisation.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of enterprise systems architecture.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of enterprise systems architecture.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of enterprise systems architecture and
  ability to discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within enterprise systems architecture by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and computer based practicals.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts. Lectures
  will be supplemented by participative case studies and independent reading on the
  issues covered in the lecture material.
- The practical element is intended to provide the student with the skills needed
  to use and understand technologies available to assist in enterprise architecture
  design.
