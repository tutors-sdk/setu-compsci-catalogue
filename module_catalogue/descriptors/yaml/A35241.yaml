aim: The purpose of this module is to further develop programming skills through the
  study of a programming language with an emphasis on the use of software development
  toolsets. This module, through the creation of a diverse portfolio of projects,
  will focus on developing well-designed, maintainable and robust applications that
  are consistent with software development best practice.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to design, develop and test maintainable, robust applications to
  solve a particular problem along with an inability to utilise software development
  tooling.'
- '40%-49%: Ability to design, develop and test maintainable, robust applications
  to solve a straight-forward problem whilst using basic software development tooling.'
- '50%-59%: Comfortable with designing, developing and testing maintainable, robust
  applications to solve problems similar to those presented in the module. Comfortable
  with using software development tooling similar to that presented in the module.'
- '60%-69%: Proficient with designing, developing and testing maintainable, robust,
  high-quality applications to solve'
- '70%-100%: Proficient with designing, developing and testing maintainable, robust,
  high-quality, elegant applications to solve complex problems that are substantially
  different to those studied in the module. High proficiency in software development
  tooling along with the use of toolsets beyond those studied in the module.'

full title: Software Development Tools
indicative content:
- Use of complex constructs and data structures associated with the chosen programming
  language.
- Programming techniques for well-behaved, well-designed, robust applications.
- Extensive use of software development tools throughout the development process e.g.
  version control, build systems, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD),
  profiling tools, code analysis, test-driven development, project management platforms,
  etc
- Read, understand, and consume APIs compatible with the chosen programming language
  e.g. command line interfaces (CLI), RestAPI frameworks, persistence, etc.
learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and computer-based practical's
  whilst capitalising on a web-enhanced learning environment.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts.
- A cooperative learning/peer tutoring (e.g. pair-programming, classroom forum support)
  approach will be adopted during the practical sessions.
- Self-directed learning will be encouraged throughout the duration of the module.
