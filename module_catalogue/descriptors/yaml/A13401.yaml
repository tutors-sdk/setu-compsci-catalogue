aim: This module equips the student with knowledge of security vulnerabilities of
  application software taking into account both web and native applications. Methods
  used to solve these vulnerabilities are investigated. Intrusion Detection/Prevention
  Systems and Malicious Software are also presented. Students will be given a grounding
  in the area of Secure Software Development. This module also explores issues pertinent
  to Incident Response and Recovery.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to describe typical security vulnerabilities of application software.
  Unable to explain the operation of IDS/IPS. Unable to describe the different categories
  of malware. Unable to describe how security can be incorporated into the software
  engineering process.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to describe typical security vulnerabilities of application software.
  Be able to explain the operation of IDS/IPS. Be able to describe the different categories
  of malware. Be able to describe how security can be incorporated into the software
  engineering process. Be able to explain the need for appropriate incident response
  and recovery.'
- '50%-59%: All of the above and the ability to discover and review contemporary knowledge
  of application software vulnerabilities, secure software development techniques,
  IDS/IPS, malicious software and incident response and recovery techniques.'
- '60%-69%: All of the above and be able to solve problems within application software
  security by experimenting with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level and the ability to analyse and design
  application software security solutions to a high standard for a range of security
  threats through the use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'

learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and practicals.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts. The
  student will be encouraged to participate in class discussions and ask questions
  to support their learning process.
- The practical element allows the student to put into practice the theoretical concepts
  covered in the lectures.

learning outcomes:
- Assess a variety of security issues, vulnerabilities and fixes that arise in applications
  and categorise them by using information from CERT, OWASP and other trusted services.
- Compare the capabilities and limitations of intrusion detection systems and intrusion
  prevention systems.
- Appraise different threats posed by various categories of malware and explain different
  techniques to defend against them.
- Justify the need for appropriate incident response and recovery measures.
- Assess how security can be integrated into the software development process.
- Formulate a variety of security attacks in a simulated environment.
