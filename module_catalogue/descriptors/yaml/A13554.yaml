aim: This module will introduce students to the principles of graph/network models
  and information theory. The module will focus on the practical application of the
  fundamental concepts to problems in computing, such as, resource allocation, planning,
  optimization problems, and software testing.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to demonstrate knowledge or understanding of the fundamental concepts
  in graph and network models, information theory and finite state machines, as outlined
  in the syllabus content, inability to apply concepts to selected problems.'
- '40%-49%: Able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts
  in graph and network models, information theory and finite state machines, as outlined
  in syllabus content.'
- '50%-59%: In addition to above, able to find the complete solution set to basic
  problems, and in addition, able to supply a reasonable interpretation of generated
  results.'
- '60%-69%: All the above, in addition be able to independently determine appropriate
  mathematical techniques to analyse applied problems and to express their work with
  rigour and precision.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Demonstrates an ability to put a
  solution into a context and assess whether such solutions are meaningful.'
