aim: This module will introduce the student to project management and time management
  skills. The student will practice these skills through building an artifact based
  on multiple strands/modules across the programme. This module will act as an opportunity
  for the student to contextualise and link cross-strand concepts.
assessment criteria:
- <40%:Inability to develop a model and present a working artifact. Little evidence
  of project management and time management throughout project.
- 40%-49%:Ability to develop a model and present a working artifact. Reasonable evidence
  of project management (e.g. Agile, Scrum) and time management throughout project.
- 50%-59%:All the above and in addition has applied concepts from more than two modules/strands.
  String evidence of the different phases through the project and how the different
  techniques have benefited the project.
- 60%-69%:All the above and in addition, be able to integrate and analyse concepts
  from more than two and at least one past module, showing an ability to transfer
  skills and knowledge across modules/strands. Shows evidence of strong project management
  and time management and of how the project has benefitted from both.
- 70%-100%:All previous to an excellent level. Shows the ability to evaluate different
  models. Shows synthesis through the implementation of cross-strand innovative artifacts.

learning outcomes:
- Apply knowledge, skills or practices from (at least two) strands in the programme
  into a model that demonstrates an understanding of the core concepts of those strands.
- Demonstrate the above model and present the resulting working artifact.
- Use a modern project management paradigm, e.g. Agile, Scrum to plan and manage a
  small to medium project, e.g. the development of the artefact above.
- Use time-management strategies (including tools) integrated with the chosen project
  management paradigm.
- Describe the application of the chosen project management techniques in the development
  of the artefact.
