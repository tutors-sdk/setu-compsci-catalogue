aim: This module explores key technologies in the provision of Cloud computing services.
  The concepts of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and `X aaS are covered to examine how Cloud services
  and applications are deployed and managed. The practical component of this module
  explores the operation and management of virtualised resources in Public and Private
  Cloud environments.
