aim: This module covers topics in introductory statistics including descriptive statistics,
  probability distributions, point and interval estimation, and statistical inference
  with applications in computing.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Has no or only rudimentary knowledge of statistics and probability; student
  interprets graphical summaries or statistical results with difficulty or often incorrectly.
  Inability to, use statistical tables and formula to determine probabilities, implement
  least squares regression, or apply statistical tests.'
- '40%-49%: Has general knowledge of statistics (central tendencies, etc.) and is
  able to interpret basic results correctly. Can construct appropriate answers to
  problems without necessarily obtaining the correct result.'
- '50%-59%: All of the above but with appropriate use of standard notation and rigour.'
- '60%-69%: All the above and in addition able to apply theory correctly to applied
  problems.'
- '70%-100%: All the previous to an excellent level. Demonstrates an ability to put
  a solution into a context and assess whether such solutions are meaningful.'

indicative content:
- 'Descriptive Statistics: data types (nominal, ordinal, and cardinal); measures of
  centre and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles); graphs (histograms,
  bar charts, box plots, pie charts, and scatter diagrams)'
- 'Probability theory and applications: probability types (classical, empirical, and
  subjective); simple and compound events; conditional probability; Bayes theorem'
- 'Probability models: binomial; Poisson; exponential and normal distribution'
- 'Correlation and regression: simple linear regression; introduction to multiple
  regression; correlation and coefficient of determination; point estimation of predictions;
  interpolation and extrapolation; variable recoding'
- 'Inferential statistics: sampling; confidence intervals about a mean or difference
  of two means; hypothesis tests on the means of one or two populations; paired tests;
  chi-squared tests'
- 'Statistical software: usage of a statistical software package such as R; formulating
  input commands to generate graphs, tables, and summary statistics; performing probability
  model calculations; calculating confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests
  for a range of problems in inferential statistics; ANOVA; multiple regression modelling;
  indicator variables; interpreting output from a statistical package; programming
  constructs and scripting'
- 'Applications in computing: elementary modelling of time to failure of devices;
  reliability and application to data backups; password security analysis; queuing
  theory and application to process scheduling'
learning and teaching methods:
- Delivery of the module will be through a mixture of lectures and computer laboratory
  sessions.
- The lectures will develop theory, lead students through worked examples and introduce
  the context for the module material.
- The laboratory sessions will be used to discuss applications of the theory and to
  use statistical software.
- Extensive use of computers will be employed to perform statistical calculations
  and create graphics necessary for analysing data, conduct simulations to approximate
  long-run behaviour of random phenomena, and use scripts to facilitate batch processing
  of a data set.

learning outcomes:
- Apply standard descriptive statistics procedures to summarise univariate data.
- Compute probabilities using counting principles and probability models such as the
  binomial, Poisson, exponential, and normal.
- Apply probability concepts to applications in computer science.
- Construct a simple linear regression model and use it to make predictions.
- Construct confidence intervals for a population mean or difference of two means.
- Use a statistical software computer package to script input for data analyses and
  interpret output.
- Communicate the results of statistical analyses correctly and effectively.
