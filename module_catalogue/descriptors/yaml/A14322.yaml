aim: The purpose of this module is to introduce the student to the fundamental concepts
  of Artificial Intelligence. The student will be introduced to symbolic A.I., knowledge
  representation, search techniques and an A.I. programming paradigm.

indicative content:
- 'History of A.I: Introduction to problem characteristics; Historical and contemporary
  applications'
- 'Knowledge representation techniques: Trees; Productions; Frames; Semantic networks;
  Predicate calculus and theorem proving'
- 'Search: Un-informed; Bi-directional; Heuristic; Constraint based; Application domains'

  based systems; Agent, reactive and blackboard systems; Non-monotonic systems; Neural
  networks; Natural language systems'
- 'Practical Programme: The student will exposed to A.I. problems in practical sessions
  using an A.I language such as Prolog'
learning and teaching methods:
- This module will be presented by a combination of lectures and computer-based practical.
- The lectures will be used to introduce new topics and their related concepts.
- The practical element is intended to provide the student with the necessary skills
  to represent and solve A.I. problems using a suitable programming language.
- Student will be expected to read ahead on lecture content.
- Student will be expected to complement lecture content with self-learning.
- Student will be expected to develop skills to solve problems using A.I. language
  in practicals.
