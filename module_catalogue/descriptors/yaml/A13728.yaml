aim: The purpose of this module is to further develop and enrich creativity by focusing
  on the creative thought processes, problem solving techniques and programming structures
  essential for developing systems responsible for more complex tasks underpinned
  by User Interface (UI) best practice. The student will further extend their knowledge
  by using their creativity when working with creative class libraries.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of creative programming.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of creative programming.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of creative programming and ability to
  discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the creative programming domain by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
