aim: Continue to develop the students' programming skills with a particular focus
  on modern web development tools, frameworks and applications. A strong emphasis
  industry best practice - with close attention software configuration management
  tools. The Studio will also support a forum for talks and seminars from industry
  on technology trends and work practices.
