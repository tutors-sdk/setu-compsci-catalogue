aim: This module is intended to provide the student with a review of univariate calculus
  and elementary complex variables with a strong emphasis on the investigation of
  the concepts using mathematical software.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Inability to graph standard functions, complete simple drill exercises in
  differentiation and integration.'
- '40%-49%: Able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts
  in calculus as outlined in the indicative content, and apply, to some degree, these
  concepts to problems in computer science.'
- '50%-59%: All the above, in addition to using the standard notation to express mathematical
  entities.'
- '60%-69%: In addition, to be able to determine appropriate mathematical techniques
  to analyse applied problems and to express their work with rigour and precision.'
- '70%-100%: All the previous to an excellent level. Demonstrates an ability to put
  a solution into a context and assess whether such solutions are meaningful.'

indicative content:
- 'Complex numbers: arithmetic of complex numbers; complex valued exponential functions
  of a real variable'
- 'Functions: polynomials; rational functions; transcendental functions; limits and
  continuity'
- 'Differential calculus: derivatives using first principles and tables/rules; finite
  differences; curve--sketching using critical points and simple optimisation problems;
  Newton''s method; Taylor expansions'
- 'Integral calculus: integration using analytical and numerical methods; application
  to averages and moments; differential equations solvable by anti-derivatives'
- 'Difference Equations: discretising differential equations and chaos'
learning and teaching methods:
- Delivery of the module will be through lectures, tutorials and computer based practicals.
- The lectures will develop theory, lead students through worked examples and introduce
  the context for the module material.
- The tutorial classes will underpin and rehearse the skills covered in lectures.
  Students will be encouraged, through the problem sheets, to construct valid and
  precise mathematical arguments and will be expected to produce solutions using appropriate
  mathematical notation.
- The practical sessions will be used to discuss applications of the theory and to
  utilise and implement mathematical software.
- The practical programme is designed to re-enforce the strong interconnections between
  the mathematical concepts covered in this module and Computer Science concepts through
  the use of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and guided development of students' own
  code. A typical activity consists of investigating a number of basic quadrature
  techniques and their application to problems in computer science.

learning outcomes:
- Compute routine calculations with complex numbers and use the relationships between
  complex-valued exponential and trigonometric functions to solve problems.
- Calculate the derivative and the integral of functions.
- Use appropriate derivative and integral methods to solve elementary optimisation
  problems.
- Explain the most important properties of the elementary functions (including piecewise)
  and illustrate these properties using appropriate examples.
- Apply concepts indicated in the syllabus content to appropriate problems and interpret
  the solutions obtained.
- Employ mathematical software to analyse problems requiring the use of univariate
  functions and simple multivariate functions.
