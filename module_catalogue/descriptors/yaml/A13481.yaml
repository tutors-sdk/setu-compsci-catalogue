aim: Instructional Design is the analysis of how people learn and the systematic development
  of instruction. This module introduces students to the core fundamentals of learning
  theories as a pre-requisite to designing effective e-learning solutions. This module
  focuses upon theories of learning and their practical implications in the design
  of effective blended and technical solutions in training and instruction.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the paradigms of learning.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of learning theories and
  their implications.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of theories of learning and ability to
  discover and integrate related knowledge in other knowledge domains.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems within the learning theoires by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate skills and tools.'
