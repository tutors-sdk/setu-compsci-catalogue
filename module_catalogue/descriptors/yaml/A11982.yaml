aim: This module is concerned with the embedded architecture of high performance processor
  systems and modern memories. The module aims to teach the skills and techniques
  used in designing embedded systems hardware. The importance of timing parameters
  and worst-case design will be emphasised and students will be exposed to Hardware
  Descriptive Language (HDL) and associated development tools for hardware design.
