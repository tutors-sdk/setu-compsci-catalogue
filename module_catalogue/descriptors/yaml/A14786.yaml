aim: This is the capstone module for Semester one; it should bring together the student?s
  knowledge on all aspects of IT and utilise many facets of their previous learning,
  with a view to identifying a suitable research problem that is to be investigated.
  This module requires the student to identify a research area of interest, conduct
  a preliminary investigation, identify suitable research question(s), conduct a literature
  review and critique and select a suitable methodology to enable them to gather and
  analyse data. In addition, it requires the student to prepare a report on the first
  stage of their fourth year project in conjunction with a learning contract established
  between student and supervisor.
