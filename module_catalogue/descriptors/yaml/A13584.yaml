aim: This module will provide students with the skills to be a Database Administrator
  (DBA) in an organisation. The module will provide students with the knowledge to
  be able to successfully design, create and manage a database architecture with a
  diverse set of tools and technologies, which will enable them to provide database
  services to support the database needs of different types of end users who are using
  heterogeneous databases.
assessment criteria:
- '<40%: Unable to interpret and describe key concepts of the design and development
  of a database architecture and implement a usable DBMS configuration.'
- '40%-49%: Be able to interpret and describe key concepts of the design and implementation
  of a database architecture and implement a usable configuration.'
- '50%-59%: Ability to discuss key concepts of a database architecture and ability
  to discover and integrate related knowledge in other disciplines like security and
  networks.'
- '60%-69%: Be able to solve problems in regards to Database architecture by experimenting
  with the appropriate skills and tools.'
- '70%-100%: All the above to an excellent level. Be able to analyse and design solutions
  to a high standard for a range of both complex and unforeseen problems through the
  use and modification of appropriate complex skills and tools.'
